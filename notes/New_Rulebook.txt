1.0.0.0 Overview

	Note to the Reader:
		This Section is a short introduction to the setting, the game, and the system of Nests & Insects. It is designed to give you a general idea of the game. It is not designed to give you everything you need to play the game. That information is found in the text that follows this Overview Chapter.

	Nests & Insects is a tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) for 2 to 7 players. One Player assumes the role of the Game Queen and describes the game world to the other players. The other players control Characters who explore and interact with the game world.

	1.1.0.0 The Setting
		Players' Characters are arthropods. Six pre-built Classes are provided in this document: Spider, Wasp, Scorpion, Ladybug, Betle, and Ants. The Characters are mercenaries; assassins and thugs, hired to invade a Nest and carry out a Job on behalf of some arthropod client. Nests are the homes of eusocial insects: the nests of Bees, Ants, and Termites. Common Jobs are to assassinate the Nest's Royalty; steal special food resources; steal or kill larvae; and retrieve an arthropod of interest.
		At the beginning of a new game, the players' Characters enter a Nest to carry out their Job armed with their natrual weapons and armor: mandibles, pincers, stingers, carapaces, wings, venoms, webs. During a Job, Characters must survive combat with the soldier castes guarding the Nests. They must also hunt or forage for food to avoid weakening and starving to death. While foraging, Characters may find food items, such as nectar and fungi, that can provide not only sustenance, but also healing and enhanced abilities.
		
	1.2.0.0
		Nests & Insects is a Roguelike TTRPG. It is inspired by computer roleplaying games ofthe Roguelike genre, like Nethack, Angband, Moria, Ancient Domains of Mystery, and later games like Diablo and Darkest Dungeon. Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis is also inspired by Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Dungeons & Dragons.
		
		Nests & Insects is designed to be played with no preparation other than reading some of the rules. At the start of a new game, players either choose a class that determines all of a Character's beginning stats (collectively called features), or takes steps to craft their own Character. The Game Queen (GQ) then rolls to procedurally generate the first Room in the entrance to the first Level of the Nest, and the Characters enter to begin their Job. After visiting a Room and defeating its challenges, Characters get a chance to rest and recoup their strength, and players can use their experience to gain new and powerful attacks. The game ends when the Characters fulfill the terms of the Job, surrender to the Nest, run away, or die.
		
		Everything encountered by Characters during a Job is procedurally generated. If the GQ wishes, she can create hand-crafted Rooms, Levels, enemies, items, etc, and include them in the game, but that is not strictly necessary.
		
	1.3.0.0 The System
			
		║ Net Hits    Degree of Success                         ║
		║ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────── ║
		║ +5 or more  Critical Success                          ║
		║ +3, +4      Total Success                             ║
		║ +1, +2      Partial Success                           ║
		║ -1, 0       Partial Failure                           ║
		║ -2, -3      Total Failure                             ║
		║ -4 or less  Critical Failure                          ║
		║ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────── ║
		║ Table 1: Four Degrees of Success.                     ║

		Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis uses a dice pool system to decide the outcome of Characters' actions. Characters have Attributes rated from 0 to 10. Whenever the players take an action, the Game Queen declares the difficulty of the roll. The Player determines the size of their dice pool based on one or more Character Attributes, then roll that many d6. The number of dice that come up as a "4", "5", or a "6" are counted as successes. The difficulty of the roll is subracted from the number of successes to obtain the net successes. If the net successes are greater than zero, the roll succeeds. If there are zero or negative net successes, the roll fails.
		
		In some cases, the GQ may decide that the degree of success matters to determine the outcome of the roll. This represents situations where the effectiveness of an action can be measured in more detail than a simple pass/fail.  In these cases, it can help to categorize the Degree of Success (DoS). There are six stages of DoS: Critical Failure, Total Failure, Partial Failure, Partial Success, Total Success, and Critical Success. Table 1 shows how the net successes of a roll translates into the DoS of the result.
		
		In other cases, the number of net successes can directly be used to determine the outcome. When a Character makes a successful attack, the net successes determine the Wounds bestowed on the targets.

	1.3.1.0 Modifiers
		
		The initial dice pool for an Action is usually standard. Attacks use an Ability + Threat Rate, for example. Circumstances and strategic decisions by the players can result in one or more positive or negative modifiers being applied to a roll.
		
		Positive modifiers add extra dice to the Character's dice pool. They increase the odds of the Player doing well, and can bring them to surpass what they would otherwise be capable of, possibly turning an overwhelming obstacle into an achievable feat.
		
		Negative modifiers remove dice from the Character's dice pool. Negative Modifiers represent conditions that reduce the effectiveness of the Character's actions, possibly turning an easy task into a real challenge. If a Character has enough negative modifiers, they may end up not rolling any dice at all!
		
		When a Character receives both a Positive and a Negative modifier to the same roll, they are applied in order. First the Character adds the Positive Modifier dice to their dice pool, and then removes the number of dice dictated by the Negative Modifier.
		
	1.3.2.0 Describing Results
		What the DoS of an action means depends on a Player's description of her Character's Intent. Once the final DoS of an action is known, the GQ describes what happens as a result of the action, taking into account the Character's Intent and the DoS. The better the DoS, the closer the result of an action comes to fully satisfying the Character's Intent.
		
		The following table can be used as a guideline for how to describe different degrees of success.
		
		║ Degree of Success  Does it work?          ║
		║ ───────────────────────────────────────── ║
		║ Critical Success   Yes, and...            ║
		║ Total Success      Yes                    ║
		║ Partial Success    Yes, but...            ║
		║ Partial Failure    No, but...             ║
		║ Total Failure      No                     ║
		║ Critical Failure   No and...              ║
		║ ───────────────────────────────────────── ║
		
		On a Critical Success, the Character achieves their objective as well as an additional reward that they were not trying to achieve. On a Total Success, the Character is able to pull of exactly what they were trying to do. On a Partial Success, they manage to succeed, but there is an unintended consequence.
		
		On a Partial Failure, the Character does not succeed, but there is an unintended boon that they have earned that keeps things moving forward. On a Total Failure, the player suffers the obvious consequences of failing their action. On a Critical Failure, the character suffers the obvious consequences, in addition to an unexpected consequence that makes the situation more trying.
		
	1.3.3.0 Roll Difficulties and Ratings (Remove decile dice?)

		║ Decile die    Range       Tens die    Numbered      Ones die    Numbered                  ║
		║ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────                ║
		║ d20           0 to 19     Not any!                  d20         0,1,...,19                ║
		║ d40           0 to 39     d4          0,1,...,3     d10         0,1,...,9                 ║
		║ d60           0 to 59     d6          0,1,...,5     d10         0,1,...,9                 ║
		║ d80           0 to 79     d8          0,1,...,7     d10         0,1,...,9                 ║
		║ d100          0 to 99     d10         0,1,...,9     d10         0,1,...,9                 ║
		║ d120          0 to 119    d12         0,1,...,11    d10         0,1,...,9                 ║
		║ d200          0 to 199    d20         0,1,...,19    d10         0,1,...,9                 ║
		║ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────                ║
		║ Table 3: Decile dice, used for quantification of percentile effects. d100 is also a       ║
		║ decile die. The d20 does not need a "tens" die and is rolled on its own.                  ║

		Some actions require quantification of their results. To quantify the results of actions on the same percentile scale as Character's Features, Nests & Insects uses decile dice: the d20, d40, d60, d80, d120, d200, and the d100 itself. The d20 is a single, twenty-sided die, with faces numbered 0, 1, .. 19. The d40, d60, d80, d100, d120, and d200 are composite dice, comprised of a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 as the "tens" die, and a d10 as the "ones" die. Both the ones and tens dice have faces numbered 0, 1, ..., n-1, where "n" is the number of faces on the die.

	1.3.4.0 Minigames
		The dice pool rules outlined in the previous sections suffice to resolve most actions a Character may take. To add more variety, and more detail, to the basic rules, Nests & Insects defines a number of "minigames".
		
		Minigames are special sets of rules for situations that are of special interest to a game. There are four minigames in Nests & Insects: Combat, Survival & Exploration; Hunting & Foraging; and Resting & Healing.
		
		Minigames are described in detail in Section "Minigames" of the "System" Chapter.
	
2.0.0.0 Characters
	In Nests & Insects, players each control a Character: an arthropod mercenary on a Job to infiltrate a Nest. Players control their Characters by describing their Character's actions, then the players roll the dice to find out what happens. The Game Queen (GQ) rests the dice and determines the outcome of the Character's actions.
	
	Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis provides rules for players to create their own bugs of death. Players may also choose a Character from one of six classes: Ants, Beetle, Ladybug, Scorpion, Spider, and Wasp.
	
	The following sections describe the Nests & Insects Characters, their classes, their Features, and the Character sheets that record their Features.
	
	2.1.0.0 Character Selection
		To begin playing the game, players can select one of the six Character classes. The class determines the Character's starting Features.
		
		If the players and the GQ prefer, a blank sheet is provided for creating custom starting Characters. Rules for Character creation can be found later in this Chapter.
		
	2.2.0.0 Character Death
		When a Character dies, the Player is free to select or create a new Character.
		
		The new Character begins in the same Room of the Nest as the other players' Characters.
		
		The new Character can start as the same class as the old Character, even if it was a custom class.
		
		2.2.1.0 The Cost of Death
			The only mechanical consequence of Character death is that a Player must start with a fresh Character, with base stats, without XP, and without any Items (though some of the Items in a dead Character's Inventory may remain on the floor of the Nest).
			
			If playing a custom class, it can be helpful to keep a record of what your Character looked like at creation if you intend to come back as the same class upon death.
		
	2.3.0.0 Character Sheet
		In Nests & Insects, Characters are described by Features rated 0-10, listed in a Character sheet specific to that Character.
		
		MAY BE REWORKED> NOT SETTLED YET.
		There are five categories of Features: Core, Combat, Survival, Abilities, and Inventory. These are covered in more detail in the "System" Chapter. They are briefly covered here as they relate to the Character sheets.
		
		2.3.1.0 Class Header
			The first area in a Character sheet is its Class Header, listing the name of the game and the name of a Character's class.
			
			INSERT FIGURE HERE
			
		2.3.2.0 Core Attributes Area
			Under the Class Header is the Core Attributes Area. Core Attributes are Features that represent innate abilities of Characters in a Class.
			
			Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis Characters have four Core Attributes
			
			
║ Core Attribute  Description                                                               ║

║ Passions (PAS)  Willpower, morale, strength of spirit, courage, and influence             ║
║ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────   ║

		2.3.3.0 Special Abilities Box
			The Special Abilities box lists Abilities that are particular to a Species. Nests & Insects classes model individuals of a species, hence each Character class has its own Specific Abilities ratings.
			
			There are five Specific Abilities that Character classes can have at creation/selection: Carapace, Flight, Swarming, Venom, or Web. These are briefly described below.
			
			* Carapace: the Character has a hardened carapace that protects her in combat. Beetle, Ladybug, and Scorpion have Carapace.
			
			* Flying: the Character can fly. Flying Characters are harder to hit in Combat by ranged attackers. Beetle, Ladybug, and Wasp have Flying.
			
			* Swarming: the Character is a swarm of individual insects, or can summon conspecifics to assist her. In Combat, a Character with Swarming loses individuals from the Swarm before taking Wounds. Ants have Swarming.
			
			* Venom: the Character has a venomous bite or sting that can bestow Effects such as Agony, Immobilised, Paralysed, or Poisoned to enemies. Scorpion, Spider, and Wasp have Venom.
			
			* Web: The Character can weave webs. Webs can be used to set traps, bind enemies, or secure an area. Spider has Web.
			
		2.3.4.0 Common Attributes Box
			
			The Common Attributes box lists Attributes common to all Character classes.
			
			TABLE briefly describes Common Attributes and their use.

║ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────              ║

		2.3.6.0 Disposition Track
		
			The Disposition Track follows a Character's Disposition, a representation of both position and morale in Combat.
			
			The Disposition Track includes reminder text to point out the direction in which Disposition Advances (increases) or Recoils (decreases) in Combat. Disposition is better the further it moves towards "Charging".
			
			In Combat, Disposition acts as a positive or negative modifier on all Actions. At "Retreating", a Character is running away from combat and cannot take Actions other than Move. At "Charging", all of a Character's Actions receive one automatic success.

		2.3.7.0 Combat Attributes Box
			The Combat box lists a Character's Initiative, Threat Rate, Survival Rate and Wounds. This is also where a Character with Swarming will keep track of their Swarms.
			
			* Initiative: Used to determine a Character's turn placement in Combat, as well as determine initial disposition when Combat begins.
			
			* Threat Rate: An attribute used to roll for most attacks.
			
			* Survival Rate: Used as the difficulty for most attacks.
			
			* Max Wounds: The maximum number of wounds a Character can take before death.
			
			* Wounds: The current number of wounds a Character has received.
			
			* Swarms: Characters with the Swarming ability lose Swarms before taking Wounds. The maximum number of Swarms a Character can have is equal to their Swarming rating.
		
		2.3.8.0 Attack Boxes
			
			The Attack boxes list the details of a Character's two Attacks. Each Character Class starts with its own two Attacks. As their Features improve, Characters can learn new and stronger Attacks. The attributes of an Attack are briefly described below.
			
			* Name: The name of the attack.
			
			* Effort: The Attribute(s) used as the Effort for the roll.
			
			* Max. Range: The maximum range of the attack. Can be Close, or Ranged + a number.
			
			* Target: Indicates how many targets an Attack affects. Can also specify an area.
			
			* Partial Hit, Total Hit, Critical Hit: Specifies what additional effects occur when the Character rolls a specific DoS for an Attack.
			
		2.3.9.0 Survival Box
			
			2.3.9.1 Inventory
				The Inventory Box lists a Character's possessions such as Food items, slaved Prey, and other items.
				
				Each line in the Inventory box has a "Depleted" tickbox that indicates whether the item has been depleted as a result of its use.
				
				Characters can only carry as many Items as there are lines in the Inventory box: that is 5 lines for 5 items.
				
			2.3.9.2 Hunger Track
				
				The Food box lists the Character's Hunger rating and has a radio-button for the Starving Effect. Starving is ticked when Hunger reaches 100%. While Starving, a Character takes a penalty in the DoS of all minigame Actions.
				
║                              ║
║ ┌[Food]───────────────────┐  ║
║ │ ○ Hunger........[___0%] │  ║
║ └<^Starving>──────────────┘  ║
║ ───────────────────────────  ║
			
			2.3.9.3 Experience Point (XP) Track
				
				Certain events in the course of exploring a Nest grant the Characters XP. While Resting, Characters can spend XP to increase their Abilities and Attributes. To increase an Ability or Attribute costs a number of XP equal to the current rating plus one: It costs 6 XP to go from 5 to 6, but it costs 7 XP to go from 6 to 7.
				A Character can hold up to 10 XP at any time.

	2.5.0.0 Character Creation
	
		2.5.1.0 Selecting Species
			
			
			
			_Diet_ Insects have a variety of diets. Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis simplifies these diets into three classes: Herbivore, Insectivore, and Omnivore. These determine what kinds of food items an insect can consume. Herbivores can only consume plant-based foods, such as nectar or honey, while Insectivores can only consume pieces of other bugs. Omnivores are able to mix their diet between Herbivore and Insectivore options.
			
			_Selecting Diet_ If your Character is based on a real-world insect, feel free to research its diet and classify it using the real-world species. Otherwise, choose Herbivore, Insectivore, or Omnivore, and consult with your GQ if the diet makes sense for your Character.
		
		2.5.2.0 Assigning Core Attributes
		
			Characters start the game with all of the Core Attributes. Players assign the following ratings to their Core Attributes as they choose: 4, 3, 2, 1
		
		2.5.3.0 Selecting Special Attributes
		
			Characters start with one or two Special Attributes, choosing from the following list:
			
			* Carapace
			
			* Darkness
			
			* Flight
			
			* Swarming
			
			* Venom
			
			* Web
			
			The Player chooses one or two Special Attributes from the list above. If the Character starts with one Special Attribute, it starts with a rating of 4. If the Character starts with two Special Attributes, they each start with a rating of 2.
		
			2.5.3.1 Swarming
		
		2.5.4.0 Assigning Common Attributes
		
			The Player chooses seven Common Attributes and distributes the following ratings among them as they choose: 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1
		
		2.5.5.0 Assigning Combat Conditions
		
			Each Character starts with a rating of 1 in Initiative, Threat Rate, and Survival Rate.

			Each Character starts with a Rating-4 food item in their inventory that matches their diet. This starting food has no special properties.
		
	2.6.0.0 Character Features (TBD)
	
		2.6.1.0 Attributes (TBD)
		
			2.6.1.1 Speed
			
				Speed represents how fast a Character moves. This encapsulates moving across a distance as well as agility and maneuverability. Many Attacks will ask the Defender to make a roll using Speed in order to move out of the way. Another common use for Speed is the Initiative Attribute.
				
				_Hex Grids_ If using gridded maps in Combat, Speed determines how many hexes a Character can move when they take the Move Action.
			
			2.6.1.2 Strength
			
				Strength represents the ability of the Character to exert force on their surroundings. Strength is used in the Construction roll to break down an Obstacle. Strength is the basis for many attacks that are about physically moving other Characters. Any time a Character tries to lift or move something heavy, they will probably have to make a Strength roll.

			2.6.1.3 Ken
			
				Ken represents a Character's quick-thinking, collection of knowledge, and situational awareness. When a Player wants to know if their Character can know some information or solve a puzzle, the GQ may ask them to make some kind of Ken roll. Ken is also used in Combat to Confuse enemies with quick thinking and fancy words.
			
			2.6.1.4 Passions
			
				Passions is the unbridled fury of a bug against the world. Passions is the strength of a leader, or the aggression of a warrior. Passions is all about enforcing the Character's will on others. In Combat, Passions is used to Charm or Intimidate enemies.

			2.6.3.2 Darkness
			
				Some Insects were born in the Darkness, molded by it. An Insect with a Darkness rating can ignore part of the negative modifiers imposed by Blind or a Room's Darkness rating, up to a number of dice equal to the Character's Darkness rating. For example, an Insect with a Rating of 2 would completely negate the penalty in a Darkness 2 Room, but would suffer a negative modifier of 1 in a Darkness 3 Room.
			
			2.6.3.3 Flight
			
				Insects were the first animals to develop the power of Flight, and they carry it with them to this day. Flight allows Insects to move beyond the reach of others, and to reach where they otherwise mightn't. A Character receives her Flight rating as a positive modifier to any rolls made to defend against Ranged Attacks, not including Area Attacks.
			
			2.6.3.4 Swarming
			
				Swarming Characters can summon conspecifics to aid them on her Job. These conspecifics can soak up Wounds and unleash powerful group attacks on her enemies. However, this benefit leaves them more susceptible to Area Attacks. 
				
				_Swarms_ A Swarming Character starts with a number of Swarms equal to her Swarming rating. When a Character with Swarming takes Wounds, they can choose to lose that many Swarms instead. Once they reach zero Swarms, they take Wounds as normal. Attacks that use Swarming also reference the number of Current Swarms. A Swarming Character receives her Current Swarms as a negative modifier to her roll to defend against Area Attacks.
			
			2.6.3.5 Venom
			
				Venom is deadly, and potent. It breaks down the minds and bodies of its victims. It can even jump start the metabolism to rush healing. Characters do not like being envenomed. Unless it heals them. But it's still a weird experience.
			
			2.6.3.6 Web
			
				Web is a signature feature of Spiders, but they are not the only Insects that spin sticky strands of silk.
				
		2.6.5.0 Advanced Abilities
		
			2.6.5.1 Chill
				
				Chill represents a Character's control of endothermic reactions. By absorbing heat from their surroundings, the Character can cause a dramatic drop in temperature. This can result in Characters gaining the Brittle Effect, which weakens their defenses.
			
			2.6.5.2 Heat
			
				Heat represents a Character's control of ectothermic reactions. Either by rapid vibrations or chemical reactions, the Character builds up a significant amount of Heat energy and disperses it into their unwitting foes. Attacks that use Heat often bestow the Burning Effect, which does damage over time.
			
			2.6.5.3 Hydro
			
				Hydro represents a Character's affinity for fluids, typically water. This can be used to spout high-pressure bursts of fluid, like a Nasute Termite's Fontanellar Gun Attack. This can also be used to represent a Character's ability to survive and move in water.
			
			2.6.5.4 Light
			
				Bioluminescence. The art of life making light. This Attribute can be used to negate the effects of Darkness in a Room. It can also be used to shoot high-powered lasers at your enemies, Burning or Blinding them. Nature truly is beautiful.
			
			2.6.5.5 Plant
			
				Characters with Plant have a close relationship with plants and fungus. They are more resistant to the Poisoned and Infected conditions. They can also use plants and fungus for more insidious purposes, like trapping an enemy in crushing roots.
			
			2.6.5.6 Static
			
				Zap. A terror of the bug world, given power. Bugs with Static are able to generate large electrostatic potentials and discharge them as blasts of lightning. Static can also be used to see beyond sight by sensing the electricity of life. I know it's more of an eel thing to generate electricity, but, come on. It's cool.
			
			2.6.5.7 Psycho
			
				Psycho is an enhancement of the mind. Psychokinesis, Telepathy, Mind Control, all are possible for a Psycho Insect.
			
			2.6.5.8 Vibe
			
				Vibe is a Character's ability to generate loud, and sometimes focused, sounds. Loud enough to rupture the organs of unprepared insects. Characters with Vibe are also more sensitive to sounds.
			
		2.6.6.0 Survival Features
		
			2.6.4.1 Inventory
			
			2.6.4.2 Hunger
		
		2.6.7.0 Attacks
		
			See SECTION for a list of available Attacks and their requirements.
			
		2.6.8.0 Effects
		
			This Section defines the rules for handling Effects. Effects are physical or mental conditions that may affect a Character during the course of a game.
			
			The Effects rules rely on the rules for Boolean Rolls in Section 3.4.2.1, and the rules for Quantification in Section 3.4.1.6.
			
			2.6.7.1 Effects Ratings
			
				Nests & Insects Characters may be subject to ten Effects, all of which are detrimental. The ten Effects are listed in the Character sheet, in the Effects box.
				
				Each Effect has a Rating. When the rating of an Effect on a Character's sheet is more than 0%, we say that the Character is "subject to" the Effect. Alternatively, we say that the Effect "applies to" the Character.
				
			2.6.7.2 Acquiring Effects
			
				Characters start with all Effects in their Character Sheet rated at 0%. A Character may acquire an Effect turing the course of the game. Characters acquire effects as a result of:
				
				* their Actions,
				
				* the Actions of enemies,
				
				* the Events that occur while they Explore the Nest.
				
				When a Character acquires an effect, we say that the Effect is "bestowed" on the Character. When an effect is bestowed on a Character, the Effect's rating may increase above 0% and the Character may become subject to the Effect.
				
			2.6.7.3 Checking Effects
				
				When a Character is subject to one or more Effects, those Effects must be checked during Combat, Survival & Exploration, or Hunting & Foraging. Each minigame determines when Effects must be "checked".
				
				When the rules of a minigame say that Effects must be checked, all Effects a Character is subject to are checked simultaneously. To check all Effects a Character is subject to, make a single Roll using the Effect with the highest rating.
				
				Compare the result of the Roll against the Rating of each Effect. Each Effect that the Roll Beats triggers.
				
				The next Sections describe how to handle Triggered Effects.
				
			2.6.7.4 Agony
			
				Resist with: KEN
				
				When an Agony Effect Triggers, the subject Character has a chance to become Stunned.
				
				Make a roll using Agony. You receive Stunned equal to the number of Successes.
				
			2.6.7.5 Bleeding
			
				Resist with: STR
				
				When a Bleeding Effect Triggers, the Character takes 1 Wound.
				
			2.6.7.6 Blind
			
				Resist with: KEN
				
				When a Blinded Effect Triggers, nothing happens.
				
				However, a Blinded Character receives a Negative Modifier on rolls that require awareness of their surroundings.
				This includes Attacking, Defending, and Perception rolls, but may also include other rolls as the GQ sees fit.
				
			2.6.7.7 Burning
			
				Resist with: SPE
				
				When a Burning Effect Triggers, the Character takes 1 Wound and their Burning Rating decreases by 1.
				
			2.6.7.8 Brittle
			
				Resist with: STR
				
				When a Brittle Effect Triggers, nothing happens.
				
				However, a Brittle Character receives a penalty to their Survival Rating and Carapace equal to their Brittle Rating.
				
			2.6.7.9 Charmed
			
				Resist with: PAS
				
				When a Charmed Effect triggers, the subject Character cannot make Attacks during the current turn. They may take other Actions and Manoeuvers as normal.
				
			2.6.7.10 Confused
			
				Resist with: KEN
				
				When a Confused Effect triggers, the subject Character is driven into a frenzy and can only take Attack and Move Actions during their turn. Targets for Attacks are selected at random. If no targets are within range, the Character Moves towards the nearest target.
				
				If the Character is not participating in Combat, Combat begins between the Confused Character and the other Characters in the Room.
				
			2.6.7.11 Immobilised
			
				Resist with: STR
				
				When an Immobilised Effect triggers, nothing special happens.
				
				However, an Immobilised Character received a penalty to their Speed and Flight equal to their Immobilised rating.
			
			2.6.7.12 Infected
			
				Resist with: STR
			
				When an Infected Effect triggers, the subject Character is bestowed a random Effect.
				
				Select an Effect at random (roll a die). Roll the Character's Infected Rating to Set or Increase the selected Effect by the number of Successes.
				
				The bestowed Effect triggers.
				
			2.6.7.13 Paralyzed
			
				Resist with: SPE
			
				When a Paralyzed Effect Triggers, nothing special happens.
				
				However, a Paralyzed Character can only take the Resist Action until she is no longer Paralyzed.
				
			2.6.7.14 Poisoned
			
				Resist with: STR
			
				When a Poisoned Effect triggers, Roll to Increase Poisoning.
				
				A Character subject to a Poisoned Effect has a negative modifier equal to her Poisoned rating to all Actions in Combat.
				
			2.6.7.15 Shocks
			
				Resist with: PAS
				
				When a Shocks Effect Triggers, nothing special happens.
				
				However, a Shocked Character cannot use Ranged Attacks.
			
			2.6.7.13 Stunned
			
				Resist with: PAS
			
				When a Stunned Effect triggers, the subject Character cannot take any Actions until the next time Effects are Checked.
				
		2.6.9.0 Inventory Items
			
			Inventory Items are the Characters' Features representing consumable resources carried by a Character and that the Character must use in order to take certain Actions, or to pay certain Costs during the Survival & Exploration, Hunting & Foraging, or Resting and Healing minigames.
			
			Players' Characters start with one Inventory Item each, determined by their Class. Characters may also find and pick up new Items during Survival & Exploration and Hunting & Foraging.
			
			Inventory Items carried by a Character are recorded on the Character's sheet, in the Inventory box.
			
			Like all Features, Inventory Items have a descriptive name and a rating that represents the amount of the relevant resource. Items also have types that describe their use, recorded in parentheses next to the Item's name. One type of Item are Food Items that can be eaten to fend off Hunger, or grant Special Abilities.
			
			2.6.9.1 Carrying Items
			
				Inventory Items are carried about the Character's insect and kept track of in the Character's Inventory. A Character can only carry as many Items as there are entry "slots" in her Inventory. Characters' Inventories have nine Slots.
				
				Inventory Slots are blank lines with a rating field and a depleted indicator (See Section "Consuming Items", later in this Chapter.
				
			2.6.9.2 Acquiring Items
			
				Characters acquire Inventory Items in one of two ways:
				
				* All Character classes start with one Inventory Item recorded on their Character sheet. In that case, an Item's initial rating and its Types are listed on the Character sheet.
				
				* Characters may find new Inventory Items as Risks or Rewards generated during the Survival & Exploration, or Hunting & Foraging minigames. In that case, an Item's initial Rating is generated by a Quantification Roll according to the rules of the minigame.
				
				_Recording New Items_ When a new Item is acquired, add an entry for it in an empty Slot in the Character's Inventory. If the Character's Inventory is full, the item is dropped instead (no entry is made for it in the Character's Inventory).
				
			2.6.9.3 Dropping Items
				
				Items may be "dropped" from a Character's Inventory either automatically, when the Character picks up an Item and her Inventory is already full; or voluntarily, when a Player decides it.
				
				_Dropped Items_ Dropped Items are removed from a Character's Inventory and cannot be used anymore, unless they are picked up again.
				
				_Automatically Dropping Items_ When a Character tries to pick up a new Item and her Inventory is already full, the item is "dropped" instead. No entry is made for the Item in the Character's Inventory.
				
				_Voluntarily Dropping Items_ A Character is free to drop Items from her Inventory at any time.
				
				_Inert Items_ When an Inventory Item is Dropped, it is left lying on the floor of the Nest in the current Room. Characters, including the Character who dropped an Item), or Nest Denizens, may pick up dropped Items and add them to their own Inventory.
				
				_Lost Items_ Dropped Items stay on the floor of a Room where they were dropped, but have a chance to be lost. Lost Items disappear, and they can no longer be found or picked up. When All Characters leave a Room where an Item was dropped (by anyone), the GQ makes a Boolean Roll with Resistance equal to Level. If the roll Beats, the item remains on the Room floor. If the Roll does not Beat, the Item is lost.
				
				_Cursed Items_ Some Items are cursed, and may not be removed from a Character's Inventory until their curse is lifted.
				
			2.6.9.4 Item Types
			
				Inventory Items can belong to one of six types. An Item's type is recorded next to its name on a Character's sheet, in square brackets. The six item types are listed in TABLE. below, along with a type symbol used to record the Item's type in a Character's Inventory, and a brief description of each type:
				
║ Item Type    Symbol    Description                                                        ║
║ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────    ║
║ Companion    [C]       A creature accompanying a Character. May be edible.                ║
║ Food         [F]       Used to pay a Hunger Cost. May bestow Effects, grant Abilities.    ║
║ Hint         [H]       May provide useful information.                                    ║
║ Light        [L]       Used to pay a Darkness Cost. May be edible.                        ║
║ Materials    [M]       Used to build a Shelter for Resting and Healing.                   ║
║ Message      [S]       Must be collected or delivered as part of a Job.                   ║
║ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────    ║

				_Recording Item Types_ To record an item's type on a Character's Sheet, write its type symbol in square brackets next to the Item's Name in the Character's Inventory.
				
				_Items with Multiple Types_ Some Items may have multiple types, the "Food" type, and one or more other types. Such Items can be used to pay a Hunger Cost and perform another function, such as paying a Darkness Cost.
				
			2.6.9.5 Changing Item Types
			
				The types of an Item may change. This happens when an Item is eaten, or when it spoils.
				
				_Eaten Items_ When a Food item is eaten, all types it has other than Food are removed from it and the Item can henceforth only be used as a Food Item. The Item's name is changed to indicate it is only Food, by appending the word "Carcass" or "Remains" to its original name.

║ Figure 20: Spider's Gloworm (left) and its Carcass (right) after it was eaten.            ║

				_Spoiled Items_ Food Items can become Spoiled as the result of paying a Spoilage Cost during the Survival & Exploration or Hunting & Foraging minigames. Spoiled Items are past their expiry date and cannot be consumed without risking adverse effects. Make sure to include "Spoiled" in the item's name.
				
			2.6.9.6 Consuming Items
				
				Inventory Items are "consumed" and may become "depleted" or "exhausted" as a result of taking an Action or paying a Cost. A depleted Item can still be used, but if it is depleted again, it becomes exhausted.
				
				_Consumption Roll_ To consume an Inventory Item to take an Action or pay a Cost, make a Boolean Roll. The Effort for the Roll is the Item's Rating. The Roll is made immediately after the Action is resolved, or in the process of paying the Cost.
				
				* If the Roll succeeds, roll to reduce the Item, Quantify with Item Rating.
				
				* If the Roll fails, roll to reduce the Item, and it becomes Depleted.
				
				* If the Roll fails and the item is already depleted, the Item becomes Exhausted. Remove the Item from the Character's Inventory.
				
				_Exhausted Items_ When an Inventory Item is exhausted, it can no longer be consumed to take Actions or pay Costs. Exhausted Items are not "dropped": they just disappear and cannot be picked up by other characters.
				
			2.6.9.7.0 Food Items
				
				2.6.9.7.1 Consuming Food Items
					
					When a Food Item is consumed, the Hunger of the Character consuming the Item may be reduced.
					
					When a Character consumes a Food Item:
					
					* Make a Consumption Roll as described in Section
					
					* Then, make a Quantification Roll to reduce the Character's Hunger Rating. Quantify with Hunger.
					
					_Effects of Consuming Food Items_ Some Food Items bestow an Effect or grant an Ability to the consuming Character. Such Items' Effects trigger as soon as an Item is consumed. Refer to SECTION for the rules of triggering Effects.
					
				2.6.9.7.2 Generating Food Items
				
					Nests & Insects Food Items are procedurally generated like everything else encountered during a Job.
					
					Generating a Food Item is done in two steps:
					
					1.	Generate the Food Item's Form.
					
						When a Food Item is first generated, all a Character knows of the Item is what it looks like.
						
						A Food Item's Form includes: a) the Item's colour; b) the Item's type; and c) the amount of the Item found.
						
					2. 	Generate the Food Item's Function.
					
						When a Food Item is first generated, the Item is "Unknown" and a Character must examine it, or consume it, to determine its Function.
						
						In general, to determine a Food Item's Function is to "Identify" the Food Item.
						
						When a Food Item is Identified, the following Functions are generated: a) the Item's Condition; b) its Alignment; and c) its Abilities.
						
					_Known Items_ Once a Food Item is Identified, it becomes a "Known" Item. Known Items are generated by simple randomisation. The circumstances in which Known or Unknown Food Items are described in SECTION. Unknown Food Items are generated as Risks while Known Food Items are generated as Rewards. TABLES in SECTION list the Chance to generate Food Items as Risks or Rewards during the Survival & Exploration minigame.
					
					The following Sections describe how to generate Food Items' Form and Function.
					
				2.6.9.7.3 Generating a Food Item's Form
						
					When an Item is first found, roll to generate the Item's Form, as follows:
					
					1. Generate the Item's Colour.
					
						Roll a d6 and match the result on the Food Colour Table below.
				
║ d6        Food Colour     ║
║ ───────────────────────── ║
║ 1         Black           ║
║ 2         Blue            ║
║ 3         Green           ║
║ 4         Red             ║
║ 5         White           ║
║ 6         Yellow          ║
║ ───────────────────────── ║
║ Table 10: Food Colours    ║
					
					2. Generate the Item's Food Type
					
						Roll a d10 and match the result on the Food Type Table below.
						

║ d10        Food Type    d10       Food Type    ║
║ ──────────────────────  ────────────────────── ║
║   1        Nectar         6       Aphid        ║
║   2        Honey          7       Cricket      ║
║   3        Honeydew       8       Fly          ║
║   4        Fungus         9       Worm         ║
║   5        Leaf          10       Larva        ║
║ ──────────────────────  ────────────────────── ║
║ Table 11: Food Types                           ║

					3. Quantify the amount of the Item found.
					
						Roll to Set the new Item's Rating. Quantify with Level.
						
				2.6.9.7.4 Identifying Food Items
				
					Food Items start out as Unknown Items, whose Form is known, but whose Function is not known. A Character can identify a Food Item in one of two ways:
					
					1.	Make a Boolean Roll to identify the Item's Function.
					
						The Player's Character uses Ken as the Effort for the Roll. They may instead use Foraging to Identify an herbivore Food Item, or Hunting to Identify an insectivore Food Item.
						
						If the Roll succeeds, the GQ rolls to generate the Item's Function. the Item becomes Known to the Character who Identified it.
						
						Otherwise, the Item remains Unknown. The Character may now only Identify the Item by consuming it, as described below.
						
						Other Characters are free to attempt to Identify the Item using their own Rolls.
						
					2.	Consume the Item and note its Effects.
						
						If the Boolean Roll to identify a Food Item's Function fails, the Item can only be Identified by consuming it, either while paying a Hunger Cost or during a Resting & Healing minigame.
						
						Obviously, consuming the Unknown Food Item carries a risk.
						
						If a Character consumes an Item to Identify it, generate the Item's Function as described in the following Section.
						
						Any Effects determined by a Food Item's Function trigger when the Item is consumed.
						
						Once all Effects caused by consuming an unknown Food Item have triggered, the Item is a Known Item.
						
						When an Item is Identified, the Identifying Character gains 1 XP.
						
				2.6.9.7.5 Generating a Food Item's Function
				
					When an Item is Identified in one of the two ways described in the previous Section, roll to generate the Item's Function, as follows:
					
					1.	Generate the Item's Condition.
					
						Roll a d10 and match the Result on the Item Condition Table below.
║ d10 Result  Condition   Description                                                       ║

3.0.0.0 System
	
	This chapter introduces the roleplaying system used in Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis.
	
	Metamorphosis uses a dice pool system, where characters are described in terms of Features rated 0 - 10 and the number of d6 rolled to determine the success or failure of characters' actions is based on the total of their applicable Features and Modifiers. Successes are counted by the number of d6s that come up as a 5 or a 6. Rolls can be made in opposition to another Feature, such as tearing down an obstacle or attacking an enemy. For opposed rolls, the GQ rolls for the opposing feature and subtracts her number of successes from the Player's successes to determine the outcome. When a Feature or Effect needs to be quantified, the GQ determines the number of d6s and then rolls them.
	
	To determine the outcome of a Character's actions, a Player begins by describing the Character's intent. The GQ interprets her intent and tells the Player the Effort and Resistance, and any applicable modifiers. Effort is generally determined by the Player's Features, and Resistance by the enemies or the Nest environment. The Player's Effort is the size of her dice pool, and she rolls that many d6 then counts the number of dice that come up as a 5 or a 6, which marks her successes. If the roll has a Resistance, the GQ does the same and counts her successes. The Effort successes are compared against the Resistance successes to determine the Degree of Success for the action: Critical Failure, Total Failure, Partial Failure, Partial Success, Total Success, or Critical Success, in order from worst to best.
	
	Depending on the Player's declared actions and the circumstances, the GQ might determine that one or more modifiers apply to the Action Roll. Positive modifiers increase the dice pool for either the Effort or Resistance. Players with a Positive Modifier to Effort are more likely to do better, but Positive Modifiers to Resistance makes the roll more challenging. Negative modifiers decrease the dice pool for either the Effort or Resistance. Players with a Negative Modifier to Effort are less likely to do well, while Negative Modifiers to Resistance can lessen the challenge. Attacks, Effects, and Manoeuvers can bestow Positive or Negative Modifiers to the Players and their Enemies.
	
	Finally, the results of actions may need to be quantified. The Game Queen (GQ) then describes the outcome of the action according to the Character's Intent and the Degree of Success of the Action.

	3.5.0.0 Minigames
		Nests & Insects is organised around four "minigames". A minigame is a set of special rules for a special game situation that Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis wants to model with more detail than its standard system. Combat is the most detailed and elaborate of Nests & Insects' minigames. The other three are Survival and Exploration; Hunting and Foraging; and Resting and Healing. Brief descriptions are listed below.
		
		* The Combat minigame defines rules for skirmishes between the players' characters and a Nest's denizens.
		
		* The Survival and Exploration minigame defines rules for characters to explore, and the GQ to roll the dice to procedurally generate, a Nest.
		
		* The Hunting and foraging minigame defines rules for finding sustenance and medicinal Food Items.
		
		* The Resting & Healing minigame defines rules for healing from wounds and Effects, consuming Food Items to reduce Hunger, and using XP to improve a characters' Features.
		
		3.5.1.0 Minigame Formulaic Actions
		
		Each minigame is characterised by a set of standard Actions that characters typically take during the circumstances modelled by the minigame. For example, during Combat, Characters typically attack Enemies. Such Actions are a minigame's "formulaic" Actions.
		
		Minigames define each of their formulaic Actions by means of a Formula that includes at least a listing of Effort, Resistance, and Modifier features and a table listing the outcome of a formulaic Action for each DoS of a Qualification Roll. The Minigame Formula Template figure below illustrates the tamplate used to define minigame formulae.

	3.6.0.0 Combat
		3.6.1.0 Combat Summary
			Combat begins when the characters and a group of enemies attack one another. Combat is divided into Rounds, divided into Turns in which characters and enemies participating on Combat (Combatants) get to act, and players and the GQ roll dice to decide the outcome of Combatants' Actions.
			
			At the start of Combat, before the first Round, Combatants' starting Disposition and Initiative Order are decided, then the first Round begins and Combatants take Turns in order of their Initiative. Combatants can take actions out of Turn, for example to Suppress an enemy; support an ally; or Resist an Effect.
			
			Players decide their characters' Actions and the GQ decides the Actions of Enemies.
			
			The Goals of Combat Actions are to:
			
			* Wound and Kill Enemies
			* Reduce enemies' effectiveness in combat
			* Cause enemies to Retreat.
			
			When a Character has as many or more Wounds as their Max Wounds rating, they are Killed. Reduced Disposition imposes negative modifiers to subsequent Actions. Once a Character or Enemy's Disposition reaches Retreating, the Combatant cannot take Actions other than fleeing from Combat.
			
			Combat ends when all Combatants on one side are either Killed or Retreating.
			
		3.6.2.0 Combat Steps
			The Combat Minigame plays out in NUMBER steps, two of which repeat until Combat ends. The NUMBER Combat Steps are summarised in the Rules Summary below, and discussed in detail in the following Sections.

			3.6.2.1 Determine Combatants and Sides
				Combat begins when either the characters or Nest creatures attack one another.
				
				All characters in the Room where Combat is taking place make up one Side of Combat.
				
				All creatures of the same Species as the creature attacking or attacked by the Characters and in the same Room as that creature make up the other Side of Combat.
				
				Characters or creatures on the same Side are "Allies", and those on the opposide Side are "Enemies"
				
				All the creatures on the two Sides of Combat are Combatants for the duration of Combat.
				
				It is possible for a creature to be in the same room as Combat and not be a Combatant. These Bystanders can be recruited or incited to fight for either Side.
				
			3.6.2.2 Starting Disposition
				Before the start of the first Combat Round, each Player makes an uncontested Roll using their Character's Initiative. The GQ makes a similar roll using Initiative for each of the enemies. Each Combatant begins at Holding Disposition, then Advances their Disposition for each Success in their Initiative Roll. If a Combatant rolls 0 Successes, their Disposition Recoiles 1.

			3.6.2.3 Initiative Order
				Before the start of the first Combat Round, and after Starting Disposition is Determined, the GQ decides the Initiative Order for all Combatants.
				
				Combats take Turns in order of the count of Successes from their Initiative Roll. The Combatant with the Highest Initiative Order takes the First Turn, the one with the next highest Initiative Order takes the Second Turn, and so on.
				
				Initiative Order is determined as follows:
				
				* For Each Combatant, their Initiative Order is equal to their Successes from the Initiative Roll.
				
				* If two Combatants are tied for Initiative Successes, the Combatant with the highest Initiative Rating takes a Turn before the other Combatants.
				
				* If two or more Combatants are still tied after the Initiative and Disposition are compared, the GQ rolls a die to break the tie.
				
			3.6.2.4 Combat Rounds
				
				Once Initiative Order is determined, the first Round of Combat begins and Combatants take Actions in Turn, in order of Initiative.
				
				Combatants can take up to two Actions per Round:
				
				* Attack an Enemy to inflict Wounds.
				
				* Resist an Effect.
				
				* Negotiate a Manoeuver.
				
				* Hold an Action to Support or Suppress.
				
				* Move up to her Speed.
				
				Characters can pass the chance to take one or both of their Actions and can take them in any combination, with the restriction that a Character can only make one Attack Action per round.
				
				_Acting out of Turn_ Combatants can Hold one of their Actions to declare an Ally they want to Support or an Enemy they want to Suppress. If they do so, they take the declared Action at the start of the declared Combatant's Turn.
				
				_Movement_ If using a grid, the Character may move a number of spaces up to their Speed rating. A Character with a Flight rating can move additional spaces up to their Flight rating. If playing without a grid, assume that the Character can move to the manner of position they want to take.
				
			3.6.2.5 Attack Action
				
				In her Turn, a Combatant can take one Attack Action targeting an enemy with either of her Attacks.
				
				To determine the outcome of an Attack, make a contested roll using the Attack's Effort and Resistance. Characters with a nonzero Carapace rating add it as a positive modifier to their Resistance against Melee attacks. Characters with a nonzero Flying rating add it as a Positive Modifier to their Resistance againse Ranged Attacks.
				
				Each Attack will specify what Features are used for Effort and Resistance Dice Pools. Effort is usually one of the four Core Attributes + Threat Rate, and Resistance is usually one of the four Core Attributes + Survival Rate. Certain Attacks may list other combinations of Features instead. The GQ decides if there are any Modifiers that need to apply to one or both sides.
				
				Once each the Effort and Resistance Dice Pools are established, the dice are rolled. If the Effort rolls more Successes than Resistance, the Attack Hits and the target takes a number of Wounds equal to the difference. Many Attacks also have additional effects on a Hit. If the Resistance rolls more Successes than Effort, the Attack misses and the attacker recoils. If the Resistance and Effort roll the same number of Successes, the Attack results in a stalemate and nothing happens.
				
				_Carapace_ If an Attack is Close Range and the target has a Carapace rating, the target's Carapace rating is a Positive Modifier to the Resistance of the Attack.
				
				_Flying_ If an Attack is Ranged and the target has a Flight rating, the target's Flight rating is a Positive Modifier to the Resistance of the Attack.
				
				_Targeting Allies_ Some Attacks Heal or Help rather than Harm. These Attacks can target Allies, but may be more difficult when targeting more capable Allies.
				
				Attacks are listed in SECTION. Each Attack has the following information:
				
				
	║ Name ................ The Name of the Attack                                              ║

	║ Range ............... How far away can the Target be?                                     ║
	║ Target .............. The Target Creature(s), or Target Area.                             ║
	║ Effect .............. The additional effects of the Attack (if any).                      ║

			3.6.2.6 Suppress Action
				
				A Combatant can take one of the following Suppress Actions on an Enemy's turn:
				
				1. Attempt to Confuse the Enemy: roll Ken vs. Ken to bestow a Confused Effect.
				
				2. Attempt to Charm the Enemy: Roll Passions vs. Passions to bestow a Charmed Effect.
				
				3. Attempt to Intimidate the enemy: Roll Signaling vs. Passions to shift Disposition Down.
				
				Following is the Combat Minigame Formula for the Suppress Action.

			3.6.2.9 Manoeuver Action
				
				ManoeuverActions provide a mechanism for players' Characters and Enemies controlled by the GQ to take improvides actions, outside of the Formulaic Actions of the Combat Minigame. For this reason, there are no special rules for ManoeuverActions and no minigame formula for them. The GQ comes up with special rules on the fly.
				
				To take a Manoeuver Action, describe the Combatant's Intent, then choose Effort and Resistance, and resolve the Action with a Qualification Roll, a Boolean Roll, or a Contested Boolean Roll. Feel free to add a Quantification Roll and bestow an Effect as a result of a Manoeuver. Any of a Combatant's Features can be used to take a Manoeuver Action. Below are some example Manoeuvers
				
║ * Lift an enemy off the ground and throw her behind her allies' lines: roll Strength vs.  ║
║   the enemy's Strength. If the Roll succeeds, the enemy is moved.          ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ * Lift an enemy off the ground, carry her, flying, behind her allies lines and drop her   ║
║   there: Roll Flight + Strength vs. the enemy's Strength. If the Roll succeeds, the enemy  ║
║   acquires Stunned.                                                                  ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ * Direct an ally to hit an enemy where she has been previously wounded: Roll Ken +        ║
║   Signalling vs. Ken. If the Action succeeds, the ally gets a positive                    ║
║   static modifier to her next Attack. Roll d40 to Quantify the modifier.                  ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ * Give an enemy the old run-around: Roll Speed vs. Speed to evade an enemy taking an      ║
║   Attack Action targeting the Character. If the Roll Succeeds, the enemy's Turn is        ║
║   postponed until the end of the Round.                                                   ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ * Bash together a barrier to protect the Character and her allies: Make a Boolean Roll    ║
║   vs. Construction or Web Weaving. If the Roll succeeds, the Character and one ally can   ║
║   take cover behind the barrier, and the next Ranged Attack targeting them has a          ║
║   negative modifier equal to the number of Successes on the Roll. After an Attack targets the characters behind the barrier, the barrier is destroyed.                                                      ║
║                                                                                           ║

║ │ Intent, as described by her Player, should guide the GQ to "houserule" the            │ ║

			3.6.2.10 Breaking from Combat
				
				A Combatant can Break from Combat as a Move Action once during her Turn.
				
				To have a Combatant Break from Combat, make a Boolean Roll with the Character's Initiative as Effort. If the Roll Succeeds, the Combatant is no longer in Combat and can take Actions other than Formulaic Combat Actions, as usual. If the Roll Fails, the Combatant remains a Combatant and cannot attempt to Break from Combat until her next Turn.
				
			3.6.2.11 Consuming Food in Combat
			
				There is no Formulaic Combat Action that allows a Combatant to consume a Food Item during Combat. War is no picnic! Combatants are also not allowed to consume Food as a Manoeuver.
				
				If a Combatant wishes to consume a Food Item, the Combatant must first Break from Combat.
				
			3.6.2.12 Joining Combat.
			
				A creature who is not in Combat can always Join Combat. The Creature may have Broeken from Combat previously, or she may have been hiding, or not in the same Room as her friends when Combat began. It doesn't really matter: a Creature can always join Combat.
				
				Joining Combat requires no Roll. A creature who is not a Combatant joins Combat at the start of the next Combat Round. At the start of that Round, before any Combatants' Turn, determine the new Combatant's Disposition and Initiative Order, then she takes her first Turn in Initiative Order, as normal.
║ ┌[Note 5]───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║

			3.6.2.13 Combat Ends
				
				When Combat ends, all Combatants cease to be Combatants and the two Sides cease to exist for rules purposes.
				
	3.7.0.0 Survival and Exploration
	
║ The Survival and Exploration minigame defines rules for the procedural generation of a    ║
║ Nest's environment. During the Survival and Exploration minigame, characters explore the  ║
║ Nest, while players and the GQ roll dice to determine what the characters find.           ║

║ In Nests & Insects procedural generation is an abstraction: no floor plans or maps are    ║
║ generated. Instead what is generated are the Features of game entities, including the     ║
║ spaces inside the Nests, the creatures that roam them, and items that populate them.      ║
  Nest & Insects: Metamorphosis provides rules for the basic procedural generation of Rooms and Floor Plans.
  
		3.7.1.0 How Procedural Generation Works
		
			The core mechanic of procedural generation is rolling on tables. The players or the GQ roll a d10 and cross-reference the result with the rows of a table. The table lists what the characters find and what happens to them while they Explore the Nest.
			
║ _Exploration Action_ Survival and Exploration starts with an Exploration Action. This     ║
║ Action is resolved by a full Qualification Roll and its outcome determines the types, and ║
║ numbers, of Events that occur as the characters explore the Nest. There are three types   ║
║ of Events: Costs, Risks and Rewards. Each Exploration Action may cause up to three Events  ║
║ to occur. A better DoS to the Exploration Action causes more Rewards to occur while a     ║
║ worse one causes more Costs and Risks to occur.                                           ║
			
			_Chance of Events_ The Chance for an Event to occur can change depending on the current Nest Level. Each Event has a base number, and either adds or subtracts the current Nest Level. In this way, Events become more likely the further the Characters venture further, while some become less likely.
			
			_Rolling for Events_ Once the type and number of Events is determined, the players roll on the relevant Event tables to find which specific events occur. For each Event to be generated, roll a d10 and look up the result on the relevant Table. Each Event with a Chance greater than or equal to the d10 roll is generated. Thus, multiple Events may occur as a result of a single Exploration Action.
			
			Events are listed in TABLES in SECTION. Nest Level ratings and their Quantification Dice are listed in TABLE, in SECTION.
			
		3.7.2.0 The Nest Environment
		
			A Nest is an environment that consists of multiple Nest Levels,each comprised of one or more Rooms, as well as Passages, Shortcuts, and Shafts connecting Rooms between them, and connecting a Level to other Levels.
			
			Levels, Rooms, and Shortcuts are all generated as Events during the Survival and Exploration Minigame. They are collectively known as Nest Environment Events, or Environments.
			
			In Mechanical Terms, Environments act as resources that can be spent to initiate Minigames, or to pay Costs. In particular, in order to initiate the Survival and Exploration Minigame itself, a Room must be spent. The characters always start the game with a room on Level 0: the Entrance of the Nest.
			
			3.7.2.1 Nest Levels
			
				A Nest Level is a group of Rooms connected to each other by Passages and connected by Shortcuts and Shafts to different Levels. Rooms in the same Level are situated at about the same distance from the ground, much like a floor in a multi-story house.
				
				In mechanical terms, Levels have a decile rating that is used as the Resistance to Exploration Actions. The Level is also used to quantify the results of certain Events, such as Obstacles or Hunger. As the Characters delve further into the Nest, the Nest Level of the Rooms they visit increases. With it, the chance for Cost and Risk Events to occur increases, and the chance for Reward Events to occur decreases. Some Jobs will specify a Level where the Job Target may be found.
				
	║ ┌[Note 7]───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
	║ │ Remember that the players' characters do not visit a Nest to loot. Rather, they are   │ ║
	║ │ hired to carry out a Job. Accordingly, Rewards they find during Exploration are not   │ ║
	║ │ treasures and riches, rather they are things that help the characters get their Job   │ ║
	║ │ done.                                                                                 │ ║
	║ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║

				_Shafts_ A Shaft is a tunnel heading downwards, or upwards, further into the Nest. A Shaft connects a Room from one level to a Room on another Level.
				
			3.7.2.2 Rooms
			
				A Room is an enclosed area within a Level. In truth, eusocial insect nests don't ordinarily have many distinct rooms and are mainly composed of tunnels. Nests & Insects takes a fantastical approach to Nest architecture, pretending that Insects have floorplans and designs of a similar (but not identical) nature to Humans. 
				
				Room Events are Rewards and are only generated when a Character takes an Exploration Action.
				
				Rooms have Features such as their Area, Height, or Darkness that require Quantification.
				
				_Passages_ A Passage is a tunnel or opening or some other kind of entryway connecting two Rooms in the same Level. Passages serve to remind the Players which Rooms are connected to each other.
				
			3.7.2.3 Shortcuts
				
				A Shortcut is a tunnel connecting the current Level with a level closer to the Job Target. In mechanical terms, a Shortcut is a Reward Event that can be spent to immediately find the target of the current Job.
				
		3.7.3.0 Event Generation
		
			
║ Costs, Risks, and Rewards are generated every time a Character takes an Exploration       ║
║ Action. The Qualification Roll for the Exploration Action sets the number and type of     ║
║ Events that occur during the Action. Then the players or the GQ roll to generate Events   ║
║ of the indicated types.                                                                   ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ To generate Events, the players or the GQ make a d10 Roll and reference the result on ║
║ the appropriate Event tables, Tables 24-26 in the following Section.                      ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ Each Event table has a "Chance" column, listing the Chance for each Event to occur, as a  ║
║ decile rating. This Chance rating is compared against the d10 Roll to                     ║

║ Events in that table with a Chance that meet or exceet the Roll are generated.            ║

		3.7.5.0 Level Rating
			
			When an Event or a Feature of the Nest Environment needs to be Quantified, the Quantification depends on the Nest Level. An example of a Nest Environment Feature that requires Quantification is the rating of Darkness in a Room, or the rating of an Obstacle.
			
			Each Nest Level has a decile rating equal to its Level. Some Events use this number as the rating for their Features, other Events require a Roll to be made using the Level Rating and use the number of Successes to determine the rating of their Feature.
			
			_Increasing Level Ratings_ The rating of the Nest Level changes every time a Character spends a Level Reward to explore a new Nest Level. At this time, the Characters add a new Room to their Environment Pool one level higher than their current Level.
			
		3.7.6.0 The Environment Pool
		
			As described in earlier Sections, Environments can be used as resources to pay Costs, reap Rewards, or initiate a Minigame. To track the Environments generated so-far in the game, Players have a communal Environment Pool. This pool is simply a list of all the Environments generated so far, and their properties.
║ ┌[Tracking the Environment Pool]────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
║ │ Players are free to track their Environment Pool as best suits them, for example by   │ ║
║ │ drawing a map of Environments and their connections and contents, etc.                │ ║
║ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║

║ One way to track an Environment Pool is to tabulate its contents. Table 28 gives an       ║
║ example of such tabulation.                                                               ║

║ In Table 28, the "Environment Id" column lists a descriptive name for each generated      ║
║ Environment (though one that should preferrably be kept short). This name is up to the    ║
║ players to come up with. For example, a Room may be the "Black Fungus Room", because      ║
║ Black Fungus was found while Foraging in it; or a Room may be the "Sad Aphids Farm",      ║
║ because Aphids were found penned in the Room and they looked sad; and so on.              ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ The "Spent" column records whether an Environment has been spent: either to pay a Cost,   ║
║ or to reap a Reward, or to initiate a Survival and Exploration, Hunting and Foraging or   ║
║ Resting and Healing minigame.                                                             ║

║ _Going Back_ Environments can only be spent once from the Environment Pool, but           ║
║ characters are free to visit them again for whatever reason, for example to try and harvest  ║
║ an Item found in the Room. Additionally, a Character, or an enemy, may be    ║
║ forced to retreat during Combat, in which case they will likely end up in a Room already  ║
║ visited. In such cases a Character can move back in an Environment that has already been  ║
║ spent, without spending it again.                                                         ║
║ The "Found In" column notes the Room in which an Environment was generated as the result  ║
║ of an Exploration Action.                                                                 ║

║ The "Connections" column notes the other Environments to which an Environment is          ║
║ connected. "Connected" means that there exists: a Passage; or a Shortcut; or a Shaft;     ║
║ that leads to the connected Environment.                                                  ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ The "Notes" column is for players to mark down anything they wish to remember about the   ║
║ Environment. In the example in Table 28 above, the players have noted that a Shelter was  ║
║ built into the Red Room, and the connections between Environments found so-far.           ║

		3.7.7.0	Survival & Exploration Steps
		
			
║ The Survival and Exploration minigame is carried out in distinct steps, listed below.     ║
║ Unlike Combat, Survival and Exploration is not divided into Rounds or Turns. Instead,     ║
║ each of the steps listed below is taken in the order in which it is listed, then the      ║
║ minigame ends. A new Survival and Exploration minigame can begin immediately afterwards,  ║
║ if the players so wish; otherwise, the players are free to control their characters as    ║
║ they see fit.                                                                             ║

║ Survival and Exploration begins when a Player declares that her Character's Intent is to  ║
║ "Explore the Nest".                                                                       ║

║ "Explore the Nest" is the formulaic Intent of the Exploration Action (described in        ║
║ Section 3.7.7.4). A Player is free to express her Character's Intent to explore the Nest  ║
║ in her own words, as long as it's clear that the characer wants to go exploring. If       ║
║ that's not clear, the GQ can always ask the Player to clarify. If the Player isn't sure   ║
║ what her Character's Intent means in mechanical terms, the decision is made by the GQ     ║
║ whether to start a Survival and Exploration minigame, or not.                             ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ If more than one Player wish their characters to explore the Nest, they can say so at     ║
║ this point. Otherwise they can do so in the next Step.                                    ║

║ 3.7.7.2 Form an Exploration Party                                                         ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ It's common for more than one Character to explore the Nest at a time. In particular, all ║
║ the Player characters may go exploring together, or the players may split their           ║
║ characters into groups that will explore the Nest separately.                             ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ A group of characters exploring the Nest is an Exploration Party. To form an Exploration  ║
║ Party the players decide between then which characters explore the Nest together. For     ║
║ each such group, one Exploration Party is formed.                                         ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ For each Exploration Party, a separate Survival and Exploration Action is taken.          ║
║ Nominate one Character in each Exploration Party to be the "Scout" of the Party. The      ║
║ Scout's Exploration Feature is used as the Effort for the subsequent Exploration Action.  ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ _Tracking Exploration Parties_ To facilitate the distinction between Exploration Parties, ║
║ if more than one are formed, the GQ or the players can assign names to each party, or     ║
║ describe the direction where a party is heading (this is despite the fact that Nest       ║
║ environments do not specify clear directions). Tere are no specific rules for this. As an ║
║ example, if the characters split into two Exploration Parties, the players can declare    ║
║ that one party is exploring "to the North" and the other "to the South". Then the GQ and  ║
║ the players can refer to the two parties as "the North Party" and the "South Party". The  ║
║ GQ will probably want to make a note of what characters are in each Exploration Party.    ║


║ 3.7.7.3 Spend a Room to take an Exploration Action                                        ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ For one or more characters to take an Exploration Action, their players must spend a free ║
║ Room from their Environment Pool. Mark a Room as "explored" in the pool, so that it is not    ║
║ spent again later. Then resolve the Exploration Action as described in the following      ║
║ Section.                                                                                  ║


║ 3.7.7.4 Resolve the Exploration Action                                                    ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ As described in earlier Sections, the Survival and Exploration minigame is initiated when ║
║ one or more players decides that their characters will go exploring the Nest. During the  ║
║ Survival and Exploration minigame an Exploration Action is taken by the exploring         ║
║ Character, or characters. This Section defines the formula for the Exploration Action.    ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ _Party Scout_ When more than one characters take part in the same Exploration Action,     ║
║ i.e. when an Exploration Party is formed, one Character is nominated as the Scout. Each
  Player in the Exploration Party takes turns being the Party Scout.
║                                                                                           ║
║ The outcome of the Exploration Action determines the number, and type of Events that      ║
║ occur as a result of the Action. Three Events of up to three different types will occur,  ║
║ depending on the DoS of the Exploration Action. The formula for the Exploration Action is ║
║ listed below.                                                                             ║

║ Cost Events stress the characters' resources and test their endurance and resilience      ║
║ while exploring the Nest.                                                                 ║

║ The following Sections define the rules for the various Cost Events generated during the  ║
║ Survival and Exploration minigame.                                                        ║

	There are four types of Cost Events:
		
		* Hunger
		
		* Darkness
		
		* Spoilage
		
		* Collapse

║ 3.7.8.1 Hunger                                                                            ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ ┌[Effects of Hunger]────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
║ │ Hunger can make a Character weak. Prolongued Hunger leads to starvation, which leads  │ ║
║ │ to death from starvation.                                                             │ ║
║ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ When a Hunger Cost is paid, the Character paying the Cost may choose to consume one Food Item from ║
║ her Inventory.                                                                            ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ If the Character consumes a Food Item, make a Quantification Roll to reduce the           ║
║ Character's Hunger rating. See Section 2.11.6.7. for the rules of consuming Food Items.   ║

If the Character does not Consume a Food Item, then:
	
	* If the Character is at Hunger Rating 10, the Character DIES of starvation.
	
	* If the Character is at less than Hunger Rating 10, the Character rolls Level and increases their Hunger rating by a number equal to the Successes of the Roll. If this brings the Character to Hunger Rating 10, they are starving and are at risk of DEATH. 
	
	While a Character is Starving, they suffer a -1 modifier to each of their rolls.
		
3.7.8.2 Darkness


║ ┌[Effects of Darkness]──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
║ │ Darkness makes it harder to see things and to do things that require vision.          │ ║

║ When a Darkness Cost is paid, the Character paying the Cost must consume one Light Item   ║
║ from her Inventory.                                                                       ║

║ A Player may decide that her Character will not consume any Light Items to pay a Darkness ║
║ Cost (even if the Character has a Light Item in her Inventory).                           ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ If a Character cannot (or her Player will her not to) pay a Darkness Cost, that Character ║
║ has no light source.                                                                      ║

║ If all of a Character's Light Items become exhausted, that Character has no light source. ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ If none of the characters in a Room has a light source, the Room is in Darkness. The GQ rolls Level to set the Darkness for the Room.
║                                                                                           ║
║ While a Room has a Darkness rating, it applies as a Negative Modifier to all Actions that ║
║ require vision.                                                                           ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ _Blind in the Dark_ If a Blind Character is affected by Darkness, only the greater of the two ratings is applied as a Negative Modifier to their rolls.

	3.7.8.3 Spoilage
	
		When a Spoilage Cost is paid, the Characters' Food Items will be depleted, and may become Spoiled.
		
		To pay a Spoilage Cost, a Player makes a separate Spoilage Roll for each Food Item in their Inventory. To do this, the Player rolls the Food Item's Rating. The new Rating of the Food is the number of successes. If no successes are rolled, the food's Rating does not change, but now the food is Spoiled.
		
		Spoiled Food is food that is expired, riddled with rot and mould and other unsavory microbes. As unappetizing as it is, Spoiled Food can still be Consumed as any other Food Item. Doing so comes with a risk, however. When a Character Consumes a Spoiled Food Item, they roll to reduce Hunger as normal. Then, they roll Strength vs. the Spoiled Food's Rating. If the Roll fails, the Character acquires Infected equal to the amount the Roll failed by.
		
	3.7.8.4 Collapse
		
		A Collapse cost represents the structure of the Nest changing. This can be due to renovations by the Nest Denizens, or destruction caused by outside forces, like water damage.
		
		When a Collapse Cost is paid, a Room in the Environment Pool is selected at random and removed from the game. Any Items in the room are lost. Any Characters currently in the room choose a connected Room to escape to. If the current Room is removed as part of the Collapse Cost, no more Costs, Risks, or Rewards are generated as a result of this Exploration Action.
		
		_Salvaged Passages_ Characters trapped by a Collapse can still find their way to the connected Passages of a Room. To do so, they must clear the Passage as if it was an Obstacle (See SECTION).
	
3.7.9.0 Risk Events
	
║ Risk Events add a frisson of excitement to the otherwise drab and boring act of slogging  ║
║ through a Nest looking for the subject of a Job.                                          ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ The following Sections define the rules for the various Risk Events generated during the  ║
║ Survival and Exploration minigame.                                                        ║

There are five types of Risk Events:

	* Obstacle
	* Item (Unknown)
	* Encounter
	* Spoilage
	* Infection
	
	3.7.9.1 Effects (Risk)

		When an Effects Risk is faced, the Character facing the Risk must check all Effects she is subject to.
		
		When an Effect is Checked, there is a chance that it will Trigger.
		
		Refer to SECTION for the rules of Checking Effects. Refer to SECTIONS for the rules of Triggering Effects.
		
		A Character gains XP equal to Level if at least one of their Effects were Triggered.
	
	3.7.9.2 Unknown Item (Risk)
	
║ ┌[Finding Unknown Food Items]───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
║ │ Food Items can be found while exploring a Nest. At first those Items are Unknown,     │ ║
║ │ meaning that while their Form is known, their Function must be Identified.            │ ║
║ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ When an Unknown Food Item Risk is faced, generate a new Food Item's Form, as explained in ║
║ Sections 2.6.8.7.2 and 2.6.8.7.3.                                                         ║
	
	3.7.9.4 Obstacle
	
		When an Obstacle Risk is faced, the Obstacle starts with an Obstruction Rating equal to the current Level. An Obstacle with a Rating of 0 is torn down.
		
		The Characters may roll STR + Construction vs. Obstruction. If they succeed, they reduce the Obstruction Rating by the number of net Successes. If a Character fails the roll, they suffer 1 Wound. Each Character in the room must attempt the Construction roll before any Character can try again. 
		
		If a Character Succeeds the roll and reduces the Obstruction Rating to 0, the Obstacle is cleared. The Players gain XP equal to Level, and have a chance to gain Building Resources. Roll Level. One Character adds Building Resources equal to the successes.
		
		Leaving a room with an Obstacle intact means that no further Risks or Rewards are generated. The room is already spent, and cannot be re-explored.
		
	3.7.9.4 Encounter

║ ┌[Nest Encounters]──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
║ │ An "Encounter" is an impromptu meeting with a Nest's denizens: its guardians, or      │ ║
║ │ their (wanted or unwanted) guests.                                                    │ ║

║                                                                                           ║
║ Encounter Tables are specific to each kind of Nest. Look for Encounter Tables in the      ║
║ Sections, later in this rulebook, on Termite, Bee, and Ant nests.                         ║

	To Generate an Encounter, Roll Level a number of times depending on the current Nest Level. Then, compare the number of successes against the relevant Encounter Table to see which Encounter(s) are generated.
	
	Level			Encounter Rolls
	1-2				1
	3-4				2
	5-7				3
	8-10			4
	
		When all enemies in the Encounter are defeated or retreated, the Encounter has been cleared. The Characters gain XP equal to Level.

║ 3.7.9.5 Infection                                                                         ║

║ When an Infection Risk is faced, roll Strength + Healing vs. Level. Characters suffer a negative modifier on the roll equal to their current Infected Rating, if any.

	If the Character fails the Roll, they gain Infected equal to the net successes. The Character gains XP equal to Level.
	
	See SECTION for the rules of the Infected Effect.

║ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║

║     3.7.10.0 Reward Events............................................................135 ║
		Reward Events give the characters the resources they need to complete their Job successfully.
		
		Remember that the Characters are not invading a Nest to become rich. Arthropod society does not understand the concept of "riches". They are here to prove their skills and complete a Job. Accordingly, the Reward Events generated while exploring a Nest are only designed to help the Characters complete their Job.
		
		The following Sections define the rules for the various Reward Events generated during the Survival and Exploration minigame.
	
║       3.7.10.1 Room (Reward)..........................................................136 ║

			When a Character reaps a Room Reward, add a Room to the Environment Pool.
			
║       3.7.10.2 Shortcut...............................................................137 ║
			
			When a Character reaps a Shortcut Reward, they have discovered a Passage that leads directly to the Level of the Job Target. Look alive you ugly bugs, it's go time!
			
║       3.7.10.3 Level (Reward).........................................................138 ║
			
			When a Character reaps a Level Reward, roll Level.
			
			Add a Room to the Environment Pool. This new Room represents the Entrance to the new Level.
			
║       3.7.10.4 Known Item.............................................................139 ║

			When a Character reaps a Known Item Reward, make a Roll to generate a Known Food Item.
			
			Unlike other generated game entities and Features, there is no table to roll on to generate Known Food Items. This is because the list of Known Food Items will change during a game and between games, as new Items are generated and Identified.
			
			Players begin knowing their starting Food Items. As their Characters explore the Nest and Identify new Food Items, the list of Known Food Items expands.
			
			To generate a Known Food Item, randomly select one of the Food Items that any Character has Identified so far. The Room now has that Food Item among its resources that can be harvested in Hunting & Foraging.
			
║       3.7.10.5 Resource...............................................................140 ║

			When a Character reaps a Resource Reward, the Room now has Building Resources among its resources that can be harvested during Hunting & Foraging.

║   3.8.0.0 Hunting and Foraging (TBD)..................................................142 ║
	  
	  In Exploration & Survival the Characters determine what Food and Resources can be found where. In Hunting & Foraging, the Characters have opportunities to harvest those Items to support themselves on the way to their Job.
	  
	  Hunting & Foraging begins when the Characters are in a Room with one or more Food Items or Resources. Players choose which Item they would like to harvest and they roll the appropriate Attribute for that type of Item. Each Item in a Room can only be harvested by one Character at a time. The following Sections describe the different harvesting methods for Insectivore Food, Herbivore Food, and Building Resources.
	  
		║ Degree of Success  Outcome                       ║
		║ ───────────────────────────────────────── ║
		║ Critical Success   Add Level to Item Rating                 ║
		║ Total Success      Add 2 to Item Rating        ║
		║ Partial Success    Add 1 to Item rating                      ║
		║ Partial Failure    Increase Hunger 1                                         ║
		║ Total Failure      Increase Hunger 1, Room Depleted of Item.                 ║
		║ Critical Failure   Increase Hunger by Level, Room Depleted of Item.          ║
		║ ───────────────────────────────────────── ║
		║ Table 1: Four Degrees of Success.                     ║
	 
	  The above table details the outcomes of Hunting & Foraging based on the DoS of the Roll. On Successes, the Character gains more of the Item. On a Partial Failure, the Character's efforts are wasted, shown by an increase in the Hunger rating. On a Total Failure, the Character is hungry, but they have also depleted any remnants of that Item that could be found in the Room. The Item can no longer be harvested in this Room. On a Critical Failure, the Character's Hunger is increased substantially on top of the Room being depleted of the Item.
	  
	  3.1.0.0 Foraging Plants
	  
		Harvesting an Herbivore Food Item uses the Foraging Attribute. The Character Rolls KEN + Foraging vs Level.
	  
	  3.2.0.0 Hunting Bugs
	 
		Harvesting an Insectivore Food Item uses the Hunting Attribute. The Character Rolls SPE + Hunting vs Level.
	  
	  3.2.0.0 Collecting Building Resources
	  
		Gathering Building Resources uses the Construction Attribute. The Character Rolls STR + Construction vs Level.
	  
║   3.9.0.0 Resting & Healing (TBD)...................................................143 ║

		In between the dangers of exploring the Nest and Encounters with its Denizens, the Characters need some well-earned time to rest, recover, and reflect on how they've grown. This is encompassed by the Resting and Healing minigame.
		
		Before the Characters can rest, they need to first make a safe space to do so. Characters will have to choose a Room that has been cleared of all Risks and Secure it using Building Resources. Once they have a safe space, the Characters can Resist their Effects, Heal from Wounds, and Spend XP. During this safe time, they may also choose to swap their known Attacks.
		
		3.9.1.0 Resting & Healing Steps
		
			The Resting & Healing minigame follows a formulaic set of steps in a given order:
			
			1. The Characters spend Building Resources to Secure a Room.
			
			2. Each Character who wants to Heal their Wounds must consume Food, then rolls Healing.
			
			3. Characters with the Swarms Attribute can use Food to call on more Swarmlings.
			
			4. Each Character has an opportunity to Resist Effects.
			
			5. Each Character has an opportunity to Spend XP to improve their Attributes.
			
			6. Characters can change their set of Known Attacks.
			
			After all steps are complete, the Resting and Healing minigame is ended. Players are free to start a new Resting & Healing action immediately, or continue on their Job.
			
		3.9.2.0 Secure a Room
		
			A Nest is a dangerous place to try and rest if you don't belong. The Characters need to Secure a Room if they want to be able to rest safely. To Secure a Room, the Characters must Consume Building Resources. Once they do, they can Roll Construction + STR or KEN versus Level. On a Success, the room is Secured, and Resting & Healing can continue in that room. There are no consequences for Failure except for the waste of Consumed Resources. Once a Room has been Secured, it can be used for Resting & Healing again at a later time.
			
			3.9.2.1 Secure a Room with Web
			
				The Characters do not need Building Resources if one of them has the Web Attribute. Instead, the Web-savvy Character Rolls Web + Construction vs Level. On a Success, the Room is Secured. On a Failure, the Character with Web gains 1 Hunger.
		
		3.9.3.0 Heal from Wounds
		
			If a Character wishes to Heal from Wounds, they must first Consume a Food Item. This Consumption does not affect her Hunger Rating, as the nutrition is spent healing from injuries.
			
			To Heal from Wounds, the Character Rolls Food Rating + Healing vs Wounds. On a Success, the Character Heals one Wound for each Net Success. On a Failure, the Character wallows in her wasted Food.
		
		3.9.4.0 Summon Swarmlings
		
			To attract and sustain a Swarm, Food is a must. To summon more Swarmlings to her aid, a Character must Consume a Food Item. This Consumption does not affect her Hunger Rating, as the nutrition goes to attracting the Swarm.
			
			To summon Swarmlings, the Character Rolls Swarms + Leadership or Eusociology vs Level. On a Success, the Character regains one Swarms for each Net Success.
		
		3.9.5.0 Resist Effects
		
			Characters in the Resting & Healing minigame have an opportunity to Resist Effects. See SECTION for the rules on Resisting Effects.
		
		3.9.6.0 Spend XP
		
			If a Character has any XP that they wish to spend, they may do so. See SECTION for the rules on spending XP.
		
		3.9.7.0 Change Attacks
		
			A Character may decide to change their list of Known Attacks. See SECTION for a list of Attacks, their descriptions, and their Ranks. Characters can only learn Attacks for which they meet the Rank. Characters can only know 4 Attacks at a given time.
