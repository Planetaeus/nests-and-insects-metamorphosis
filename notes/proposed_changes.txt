END CHARACTER SHEET

Experience: Risks are how the characters gain experience (XP). Whenever the party resolves a Risk,
each character gains 1 XP to assign to any one attribute, condition, or ability.

Specific Abilities:
Carapace: If an Attack has keywords Crushing, Piercing or Shredding and the target has
Carapace > 0%, the target's Carapace rating is a negative static modifier to the Attack Roll.
Carapace also acts as a positive static modifier to any Impact rolls.

Flying_ If the target of an Attack has Flying > 0%, the target's Flying rating is a
negative, static modifier to the Attack Roll. Additionally, Close range Attacks can only
target a Combatant with Flying > 0% if the attacker also has Flying > 0%.

Web Weaving: Allows the player to set traps, secure an area, and hinder enemies. Web Weaving is
a positive static modifier to all Construction rolls and used to create structures or secure an area.
as well as all Healing rolls. Acts as a Positive Static Modifier to Web Attacks.

Swarming: A character with Swarming can summon additional creatures to fight with them as one.
Their Wound Maximum increases by Swarming / 10, rounded up. These additional wounds do not inflict
penalties when lost, but they can only be healed during the Resting & Healing minigame.
Some attacks may also change based on the number of creatures in the swarm.
When a swarm of creatures is hit by an Attack that would kill the target, it takes 2 wounds instead.

Venomous: Allows the character to inflict Poisoned on their foes. When a creature with Venomous > 0% makes an Attack Roll with the Venomous Keyword, their Venomous Rating acts as a positive static modifier

Combat:
In Combat, Characters can make one each of the following actions during their turn:
Attack Action: Make an Attack Roll
Resist Action: Resist an effect
Tactical Action: Support an Ally, Suppress an Enemy, or make a Manoeuver

Hunting and Foraging Minigame
1. Each player chooses a room to hunt or forage in. The room must have a food item or a resource in it to engage in hunting or foraging.
2. Each player declares what they are hunting or foraging. Each item in a room can only be harvested once per Hunting and Foraging Minigame.
3. Each player makes a Roll with the room's Level Rating as the Resistance. The effort depends on what they are harvesting. For a carnivore's food, make a Hunting Roll. For an Herbivore's food, make a Foraging Roll. For a Building Resource, make a Construction Roll.
4. If the player finds an Item or Resource, make a Quantification roll to set the rating. Use the Room Level's quantification die for the Roll. If a

Area Attacks: The user makes a roll against their Threat Rate. This determines whether the attack Hits or Misses. For each target in the area, use their resistance to determine if it is a partial or total hit. Then, apply all relevant modifiers for that target. Targets suffer the effects of the attack's degree of success against them, and if the attack missed against any of the targets, the attacker suffers the most egregious effects.

New Proposals: Pivot rules to support more of a survival adventure game. Put more focus on establishing shelters, gathering food, and the dangers of the hive.

Create standard body-part options that feed into the different types of attacks.
To go with this, no more "Base Attack" and "Special Attack", there will just be a list of attacks that a character has access to.
Once you have the specific body parts, the damage and additional effects of attacks will be determined by your attributes and specific abilities. Or, instead of specifying body parts, just have requirements for specific Attacks.
Actually, I quite like that. Each character can have two different Attacks equipped at a time. During a Rest, the character can swap any of their Attacks for a different Attack they meet the pre-requisite for. This way, I can forget about trying to balance or implement a system where players have to constantly re-calculate their damage and effects any time they level up. All I need to do is have a list of pre-made attacks laid out, and then give each attack a requirement involving one or more of: Speed, Strength, Ken, Passions, Carapace, Flying, Swarm, Venomous, and Web Weaving. Maybe also Healing and Eusociology.

Create new Specific Ability: Natural Blindness, which allows the character to ignore Blindness and Darkness if the rating is less than their Natural Blindness. Each player would start at a set natural blindness, and special food might increase it.

When you earn XP, choose an Attribute, Common Ability, or Special Ability with rating greater than 0. Tick the box next to the chosen Feature. 
Gain XP from:
Rolling Critical (Success or Failure)
Rolling Doubles
After removing an Effect from yourself
When the party defeats an Encounter
When the party spends an XP Reward
When you consume a Food of XP

Passage vs Room..?
Explore Passages
Hunt/Forage in Rooms
The lowest Event that is matched by the Boolean Roll is the one that happens? No.
Passages are a CHANCE to generate a new room in the pool. This still doesn't make much of any sense as a cost, unless it forces you to roll a room. Change out Passage as a cost with forcing the players to risk an unspent room. Call it "Collapse" or "Renovation".

	Spoilage

	Item (Unknown)
	Infection
	
Collapse: Spend an unexplored room from the Room Pool. If not, give up an explored room.

Renovation: Choose a random explored room. Make a roll. On a good result, the room changes, but is now an unexplored room that still has its existing connections. On a bad result, the room is removed from the room pool, along with its existing connections.

Have combat be like Darkest Dungeon? (all characters are in a line, front to back)
Have combat be like my perception of FF (all characters in a line, left to right)
These drastically simplify the gameplay in combat.
Given how crunchy this combat is, it's helpful to have clear indications of who's in range. Lineups can serve this purpose without requiring new maps for each room. Can have enemies come in waves.
Fixed number of columns, fixed number of rows.

Alternatively, Roll from select set of room shapes and select set of obstacle floor plans.
Room Shapes
- Donut
- H-way
- Tee
- Pi
- Square
- Hexagon
- Circle

Obstacles:
- Holes
- Stalactites
- Big solid thigns on ground (rocks, stalagmites, piles of shit)
- Water
- Webs

Floor Plans:
- Big thing in middle
- Big thing in middle, smaller same things around
- Interspersed things

Movement = Speed / 10.
Flying Movement = Fly / 10.
Swimming Movement = Swim / 10. If a bug has no Swimming rating, their Swimming movement is 0.

Success vs Failures: A successful attack does what it says on the tin. A failed attack will apply inverse effects in a way that makes sense. (EG attacker stunned/bleeding, bonus on next attack against you, heal ability poisons/bleeds/infects instead of heals)

Encounter Generation:
- Roll a die for number of enemies in the encounter

When a roll is made with the chosen stat as the effort, resistance, or as a modifier, if the roll is equal or lower to the stat, you get an XP

Moves that:
- Heal status conditions on self, allies
- Advance or recoil self, enemies, allies
- Move self, enemies, allies
- Include field to have Special and Common abilities as modifiers on attacks.
