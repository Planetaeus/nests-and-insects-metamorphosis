1.3.0.0 The System

- People are more used to mental arithmetic than abstract interval arithmetic
	Roll under Effort -> "match"
	Roll over Resistance -> "beat"
	Think about different terminology, or different ways to represent the system

1.3.1.0 Modifiers

- Use a different way to represent the shifts up and down
	Display a table showing the different DoS in a hierarchy

Critical Success
Complete Success
Partial Success
Partial Failure
Complete Failure
Critical Failure

Thought: Show that shifting up and down just moves them up and down this list.
Modifier Thoughts: Disposition should be on more of a sliding scale, instead of just five stages of dispisition, do it like 5% at a time

Possible Suggestion

Advance That Way ->								       <- Recoil That Way

Recoiling: Fixed Negative Modifier |	   | Advancing (Positive Modifier Relative to Effort)
Retreating | 20% | 15% | 10% | 5% | Holding | Effort+5% | Effort+10% | Effort+15% | Effort+20% | Charging

Alternate Suggestion:

Advance That Way ->					     <- Recoil That Way
Recoiling: Static Negative Modifier|	     |Advancing: Static Positive Modifier
Retreating | 80% | 60% | 40% | 20% | Holding | 20% | 40% | 60% | 80% | Charging
Retreating: When a character begins retreating, they cannot take Tactical Actions, but they can use a Resist Action to attempt to steel their mind.
Make a Boolean Roll with Ken. On a success, the character is no longer retreating.

Working Disposition:
║│   ○ Retreating ○ 40% ○ 30% ○ 20% ○ 10% ○ Holding ○ 10% ○ 20% ○ 30% ○ 40% ○ Charging    │ ║▓

Thoughts: There are too many negative modifiers to accumulate, and not enough positive modifiers.
Combat starts to spiral out of control with nobody being able to accomplish anything.
The most stable point of combat seems to be with everyone Retreating.
Either remove Wound penalties, or remove Disposition system.

2.3.2.0 Attribute Areas

CHARACTER CREATION: Possible Starting Array of Attributes:
25, 30, 30, 35, 45, 45, 55, 60

The XP Tickboxes are mentioned, but awarding XP is never explained.
And neither is using XP.

2.3.3.1 Condition Box
CHARACTER CREATION: Ideas for starting Condition stats
Assign 35, 45, and 55 between Initiative, Threat Rate, and Survival Rate.
Max Wounds = Stamina / 10, rounded up.

2.3.4.2 Luck Box
There doesn't seem to be any reference for "Luck" in the game.
Consider applying as a positive modifier to all your rolls?
Proposal:
Rearrange Luck scale so that 00% is the bottom of the scale. Players start at 11%.
Luck is a positive modifier to all rolls.
Working Luck Box
┌[Luck][Positive Mod to All Rolls. Roll Doubles to set.]──────┐ ║▓
│ [00%].[11%].[22%].[33%].[44%].[55%].[66%].[77%].[88%].[99%].│ ║▓
└─────────^───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║▓

THOUGHTS ON XP:
Whenever a character rolls under their luck modifier, they gain 1 XP that they can assign to any of their things
Whenever the party overcomes a Risk event, each character assigns 1 XP to a condition, ability, or attribute of their choice.

2.3.5.1 Specific Abilities Box

Spider does not have any "Web Weaving" ability. It is 0%.
CHARACTER CREATION:
Choose two Specific Abilities to start at 30%, or One Specific Ability to start at 50%.

2.3.5.2 Common Abilities Box
Resting & Healing minigame not described.
Foraging & Hunting refer to finding food items, is this meant to be separate from the event to get a food item?
CHARACTER CREATION: Starting spread of Common Abilities:
25, 30, 30, 35, 40, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60

2.4.0.0 Character Classed (TBD)
Section could be used to give an overview of each class before the in-depth class descriptions.

2.5.0.0 Ants
Ants start with the Blind condition 100%, but the rulebook never tells you what this *means*
Is Blindness bad? Does being Blind somehow give you protection from the darkness? Why?

Thoughts: Don't use Quantification Dice for leveling skills. It has way too much catapult potential.

2.11.0.0 Character Features (TBD)
Blank section, should have detailed descriptions of Features, Attributes, Combat Conditions, Survival Fatures, Abilities.
2.11.5.3
Combat does not specify when Effects must be checked.
THOUGHTS: Check Effects at the start of a creature's turn.

4.6.1.0 Worker Termite
1d20 wounds max is a lot of health for something that has a 90% chance for an 80% chance to
summon more enemies. On the table of summoned insects, there is a 55% chance of summoning another
termite that has the same Alarm Pheromones ability. And even without the prospect of summoning additional
termites, the Minor Termite Soldier has high enough Initiative, Threat Rate, and Survival rate to be difficult for
anyone in the group to touch, and threaten them back greatly.
Also, once again, BLINDNESS DOES NOTHING

Change Base Attack and Special Attack to be two separate attacks that you try, each with their own DoS.

Step 6: Identify Unknown Items: For each unknown item the party has, one person can attempt to identify.
Step 7: Consume Food - Each character may consume a food item to reduce their hunger. If they do, they may also roll to reduce one effect they suffer.
Step 4: Each player can make one Rest & Heal Roll on themselves or another player.

Special Attacks
Special Attacks are high risk, high reward moves available to insects.
They have chances to inflict higher damage, higher effect chances, and more debilitating effects.
Some special attacks may also have chances to inflict their damage or effects over an area.
The tradeoff is that these attacks may also result in more severe costs of the attacker.

Venom Spray (Requires Venomous): Project venom at a target
Web Sling (Requires Web Weaving): Throw webs over a target or area to ensnare them
Swarming Attack (Requires Swarming): Attack all targets in an area.

Special Abilities and Attacks		

Carapace:
Allows for a Charging attack, either slamming the basic armor into enemies, or a specialized
part of the armor, such as a horn. These attacks inflict damage in an area, but risk pain to
the user.

Venomous:
Shredding, Piercing, and Projectile attacks can also inflict one of the following effects:
Agony	Paralysed	Poisoned	Instant Death (Critical Hits Only)
Venomous can also provide an alternate use that Heals wounds to allies instead of inflicting them to enemies.

Swarming:
Swarming provides some additional options for a special attack.
1. Attack becomes Area. Target takes same damage as Basic Attack, but other targets in Area also take damage.
2. Autothysis: Swarm Members can sacrifice themselves, detonating to inflict damage and status on enemies. On a success, Attacker loses 1 Swarm or dies. On a failure, Attacker loses 2 Swarm or dies. 
On Basic Attacks, Swarming also increases the damage dealt by 1 Wound for each creature in the Swarm.

Flying:
Though Flying offers great defense and maneuverability, it can also come at a great risk. Special Attacks inflict Stunned on the attacker when they miss.

Web Weaving:
Enables a Medium range Projectile Special Attack. This attack does no damage, but can greatly immobilise enemies, and can also be used to stabilize Allies who are bleeding.

Rework Enemies:
Add Juvenile forms of the different Castes
Juvenile Termite Workers
Juvenile Minor Termite Soldiers
Juvenile Major Termite Soldier
Juvenile Nasute Soldier
Adjust encounter table so that only certain ones are accessible on certain levels
Also adjust Swarming Summons tables, as well as Swarming stats.

Need some kind of rules for how to travel between rooms
	Speed determines how far you can go in one trip
	Sneaking, Perception, Eusociology help you get through without encounters
	Need to be Costs & Risks to travel as well. Player characters are not in every room all the time. Players can secure rooms to cause them to not
	Maybe not use a static number for how far you can go, just look at how many connections you have to travel through.

Resistance = Highest Level Room passed through + # of Rooms being traveled through. Roll Speed + Sneaking + Exploration
Need better rules for when and where they can camp & rest
	Each entrance of a room needs to be secured before it can be used to rest?

If Speed is tied to movement speed, then it really can't also be tied to initiative AND threat rate AND survival rate. It just becomes the only stat worth investing in.
New Determinations:
Speed + Passions = Init
Strength + Passions = Threat Rate
Strength + Smarts = Survival Rate
Max Wounds = Strength / 10
Movement = Speed / 10
Max Swarm = Swarming / 10

Sources of Experience:
Encounter (All members of Exploration Party)
Identify an unknown item (Character who rolled)
Overcome an Obstacle (Character who rolled
Discover a new Level. (Character who rolled)

Uses for Smarts:
- Resist Confused
- Bestow Confused
- Modifier to Charm
- Suppress an Ally's Confused
- Resist Blind
- Resist a Manoeuver Action for one character to signal another for a weak spot
- Part of Initiative + Survival Rate

Uses for Ken:
- Identify unknown items
- Resist Confused
- Manoeuver to direct an ally to where an enemy was hit before

New Uses for Ken (bundled):
- Bestow, Resist, and Suppress Confused
- A character's Ken is a negative modifier applied to any roll to bestow Charmed on them.
- Resist Blind
- Survival Rate calculation
- Manoeuver Action: Roll Ken + Signalling vs. Ken to direct an ally to where an enemy has been hit before.
- Identify Unknown Items

Uses for Speed:
- Initiative
- Movement
- Travel
- "Give an enemy the old run-around"

Uses for Strength:
- Resist Immobilised
- Lift an enemy off the ground and throw her behind her allies' lines: roll Strength vs. Strength
- Lift an enemy off the ground, carry her, flying, behind her allies lines and drop her there: Roll Flying + Strength vs. the enemy's Strength
- Resist Bleeding, Infected, Poisoned
- Eat spoiled items
- Threat Rate
- Survival Rate
- Maximum Wounds

Uses for Passions:
- Roll Passions vs. Passions to bestow Charmed
