 Arthropods
	Six classes
		Spider
		Wasp
		Scorpion
		Ladybug
		Beetle
		Ants
	Mercenaries

	Thugs
	Hired to invade a Nest on behalf of a client
	
Nests
	Bees, Ants, Termites
Jobs
	Assassinate Queen/King

Begin game with natural weapons
	Survive combat
	Food can sustain, heal, or enhance
	
Procedurally generate the nests

Fuzzy d100 (fd100)
	Roll d100 and compare against Effort and Resistance
	"Match Effort" = Roll at or under Effort
	"Beat Resistance" = Roll above Resistance
	Match & Beat => TS
	Match & !Beat => PS
	!Match & Beat => PF
	!Match & !Beat => TF
	
ADD Survival Rate and Initiative have INITIAL values based on Core, but after that they are XP-driven.

Four Minigames:
Combat
Survival & Exploration
ADD Hunting & Foraging
ADD Resting & Healing

Character Selection
Six pre-generated characters
ADD Blank Character Sheet with rules for character creation

Only mechanical punishment for death is fresh character without XP or items.

Luck Bar: Take it out of rolls, it's too many modifiers to keep track of.
Instead, when you roll doubles ON A D100, you fill that bubble and gain an XP in an attribute of your choice. You cannot mark the same doubles again until you've filled all the bubbles. When you fill all the bubbles, you empty all bubbles and can now fill them again.
This puts the characters in cycles of faster and slower XP gain.

Speed & Skill -> Speed: How fast can you move + precision and fine manipulation
Strength & Stamina -> Strength: Physical strength and endurance
Smarts & Ken -> Ken: Intelligence, problem solving, knowledge of the world
Charms & Passions -> Passions: Charisma, communication talent, strength of spirit.

Condition Box (Combat)
	Initiative -> Keep. Starts as avg of SPEED & Ken
	Threat Rate -> Drop. Each attribute will be the Effort for attacks
	SR -> Keep. Starts as avg of STR & Passions
	Wounds/Max -> Max Wounds = SR / 10 rounded down.
	
Attack Boxes These are going to change even more than I already have. The attacks will be listed as strips across the sheet so it will be easier to copy/paste them into a sheet, and possibly to give them more room.

Hunger & Starving: Break out from just a number to a bar. In increments of 20, Hunger becomes a negative modifier on rolls.

Specific Abilities -> Special Abilities
There are five special abilities that can be chosen at character creation:
	Carapace: A hardened carapace that protects her in combat.
	Flying: Flying characters are harder to hid in combat by terrestrial attackers.
	Swarms: A swarm of individual insects, or can summon conspecifics
	Venom: Venomous bite or sting that can bestow Agony, Immobile, Paralyzed, or Poisoned
	Web: Weave webs to set traps or secure an area.

Common Abilities
	Construction:	Make traps, secure a room for Resting & Healing
	Eusociology:	Knowledge of the ways of Nests & their inhabitants
	Exploration:	Search a room or scout ahead to unexplored Rooms
	Foraging		Search for Herbivorous sustenance

Attributes: TBD

Combat Conditions: TBD

Survival Features: TBD

Abilities: TBD

	Agony
		When triggered, boolean roll with Agony as Resistance
		If beat, nothing happens
		If match, you are stunned. Quantify with Agony.
	Bleeding
		When triggered, take 1W
	Charmed
		When a charmed effect triggers, the subject cannot use Attacks this turn.
	Confused
		When a Confused effect triggers, the character can only move and use Attacks. It selects targets randomly from among those in range of its attack.
	Immobilised
		Character can either use an Attack or a Maneuver this turn, not both.
	Infected
		Choose an effect at random. Roll to set or increase that effect, Quantify with Infected.
	Paralyzed
		Nothing happens. A Paralyzed character cannot take actions until no longer paralyzed.
	Poisoned

	Stunned
		The character can only roll to resist Stunned.

Item Types
	Companion
	Food
	Hint
	Light
	Materials
	Message
	
	When you eat an item that has multiple types, it is only food.
	
	Consuming Items
		If you match the food item, roll to decrease.
		If you beat, roll to decrease, and becomes depleted.
		If you beat and already depleted, item is exhausted and removed.
		
	Consuming Foods
		Make a consumption roll.
		Roll to reduce Hunger, Quantify with Hunger.
	
	Generating Food Items:
		1. Color the Food
		2. Generate Type
			Nectar
			Honey
			Honeydew
			Fungus
			Aphids
			Crickets
			Fireflies
			Worms
		3. Quantify with Level
	Identifying Food in two ways:
		1. Boolean roll, using Ken or Foraging
			On a success, know what it does.
			On a failure, character cannot attempt to identify again. Others can attempt.
		2. Consume
			Eat it, and find out.
	Generate Food Item
		1. Condition
			Ordinary
			Blessed
			Cursed
			Spoiled
			Nutritious
		2. Item Conditions
			GOOD
				Healing
				Relief
				Restoration
				Shielding
				Standard Special
				Weird Special
				Courage
				Rage
				Venom
				Clarity
			BAD
				Agony
				Bleeding
				Blindness
				Charming
				Confusion
				Immobilisation
				Infection
				Paralysis
				Poisoning

Modifiers
	No more than two dramatic modifiers to a single actions

Quantification
	01 - 10 	=> d20
	11 - 30 	=> d40
	31 - 50 	=> d60
	51 - 70 	=> d80
	71 - 90 	=> d100
	90 - 110 	=> d120
	111+ 		=> d200
	
Boolean roll: Simple, just roll against Effort
Contested Boolean Roll: Effort + Resistance
But this is different from a full qualification roll

Acting in Tandem: TBD

Minigames:
- Combat
	Fight stuff
- Survival & Exploration
	Procedurally generate a nests
- Hunting & Foraging
	Find sustenance and medicinal food items
- Resting & Healing
	Healing, reduce Effects, consume food
	
Combat Steps:
1. Who's fighting and on what side
2. Starting Disposition
	Make a boolean check against Initiative
3. Determine initiative Order
	If multiple people are tied with initiative, roll a die/flip a coin
4. Combat Round Begins
	Two Actions. Only one Action can be an Attack.
	Action Types
		Attack
		Suppress
		Support
		Resist
		Manoeuver
		Move
	You can hold one of your actions. If you do, declare another Character that you are going to Support or Suppress at the start of that Character's turn.
5. Step through each combatant in Initiative Order
6. Repeat the round until all are retreating or killed
7. Combat ends

Attack Action
	Carapace: May be applied as a negative modifier against physical attacks
	Flying: May be applied as a negative modifier against ranged and area attacks.
Suppress Action
	Intimidate: Roll to reduce enemy disposition (Resisted with Passions)
	Charm: Roll to bestow Charmed (Resisted with Passions)
	Confuse: Roll to bestow Confused (Resisted with Ken)
Support Action
	Rally: Roll Leadership vs Passions to improve Disposition
	Focus: Roll Ken v Confused to reduce Confused
	Shake: Roll Passions v Charmed to reduce Charmed
Resist Action
	Roll EFFORT v Effect to try and reduce Effect
Manoeuver
	Make a roll to do a cool thing, you can argue this, but the Manoeuver doesn't do damage.
	Example Manoeuvers
		Roll STR v STR to make them lose a turn of combat
		Flying + STR v STR to give Stunned
		Ken + Signaling/Perception v Ken to give Ally a positive modifier to next Attack
		SPE v SPE to postpone enemy's turn to end of Round
		Construction or Web to give modifiers on Sneaking or Ranged
		Boolean vs Initiative. If success, you can run away and take other actions. If fails, can't.
Move
	The character uses one of their movement modes to move up to Rating/10 squares.

Can't eat during combat, have to break out of it first.
Anybody can join, and come in during the next round.

Survival and Exploration
	Environment
		Nest Levels
			Percentile rating used as resistance to exploration, and some procedural generation
			Characters not in it for money, but power
		Rooms
			Rewards that are generated when a character explores
			Area, Height, Darkness
			Can have resources
			Can be changed or removed by Cost and Risk events.
		Passages
			Not actually generated, but used to mark the connections between rooms. More of an abstract.
		Shortcut between level and job target
			Reward that connects current room to job target's level.
		Shafts between levels
	Event Generation
		Roll Exploration v Level to determine how many costs/risks/rewards you generate.
		Roll for Events 1
		Roll for Events 2
		Roll for Events 3
	Level Rating
		Screw the three dice, keep high rewards with high risks/costs.
		When you spend a Level Reward, Roll Level's Quantification die to increase Level.
	Environment Pool
		Name the room
		Is it spent?
		Where did you find it?
		Where does it lead?
		What's in it?
		Starting Room can be spent for multiple Exploration actions.
	Steps
		1. Spend a Room
			Start with three rooms in the room pool. When you have no rooms left to spend, you fail the mission.
		2. Roll Exploration vs. Level
			CS	Reward, Reward, Reward
			TS	Risk, Reward, Reward
			PS	Cost, Risk, Reward
			PF	Cost, Risk, Risk
			TF	Cost, Cost, Risk
			CF	Cost, Cost, Cost

Costs
	Hunger
		Either consume a Food Item or:
		If already at 10 hunger, you die.
		If less than 10, roll Level to increase Hunger and the Character gains 1 XP.
	Effects
		Check all Effects.
	Darkness
		Consume a Light item, or the room is shrouded in Darkness.
		Darkness is a negative modifier on all rolls that require Vision
	Spoilage -> Moved to Risks
	Collapse
		Make a Boolean Roll, Resist with current Level.
		If the roll beats, nothing happens.
		If the roll matches, you must remove a room from the Environment Pool. Any room can be removed, except for the Start. If the current room is Collapsed, the current Exploration Turn ends, and the characters retreat to the nearest room.

Risks
	Encounter
		Encounter does not ALWAYS have to end in Combat. I guess. If you're BORING.
		Roll on the Encounter table for the current type of Nest.
		To generate, make a Boolean Roll, and compare it against the Encounter table. Each encounter whose Chance is matched by the Encounter Roll are generated.
		When an Encounter is completed (by combat or other means), the characters gain 1 XP.
		If all players leave the room without completing the Encounter, no further events are generated in this room. The room is already spent, and cannot be re-explored.
		The players may return to the room later to complete the encounter and receive XP for doing so.
	Unknown Item
		Form is known, Function needs to be identified.
		Generate a food item's form.
	Obstacle
		The Obstacle has an Obstruction rating equal to the current Level's Difficulty.
		An obstacle with rating 0% is torn down, and the Characters gain 1 XP.
		Characters may roll Construction vs Obstruction, reducing the Obstacle's rating by the number of net successes.
		If a character fails the roll, they receive 1W.
		Leaving a room with an Obstacle intact means that no further Risks or Rewards are generated. The room is already spent, and cannot be re-explored.

║ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────                   ║
	Spoilage
		Each character makes a single Boolean Roll. Compare the roll to each Food Item's Rating.
		
		Roll for each food item.
			For each success, reduce that food item's rating by 1.
			If no successes are rolled, the food is not reduced, but it becomes spoiled.
		If the roll beats, the Food Item is a-okay.
		If the roll matches, the Food Item becomes spoiled.
		Spoiled Food
			First, consume the item as normal.
			Then, Roll STR vs. Food Rating:

║ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────                   ║
	Infection
		Each character rolls STR + Healing vs. Level + Infected. If a Character failes the roll, they gain Infected equal to the amount the roll failed by.
		A character Infected this way gains 1 XP.

Rewards
	Room
		Add a room to the Environment Pool
	Shortcut
		Buckle up you ugly bugs: It's time to party
	Level
		Roll to set level of new room. Quantify with Current Level.
		Only one Level reward per Exploration Action? No. Dumb. I don't like it.
	Known Item
		Randomly choose an item from among Known Food Items. That food Item can be found in this room.
	Resource
		One character Acquires Building Resource
		If already have, roll to increase, Quantify with Level.
		If not already, roll to set, Quantify with Level.
	Secret
		Generate a random Cost, Risk, or Reward.
