Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis
===============

This is the repository for the rulebooks and code of Nests & Insects, a Roguelike
Tabletop Roleplaying Game.

The Game
--------

Nests & Insects is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) for 2 to 7 players. One
player assumes the role of the Game Queen (GQ) and describes the game world to the
other players. The other players control characters who explore and interact
with the game world.

### Characters

Players' characters are arthropod mercenaries, assassins, and thugs, hired to
invade a Nest and carry out a Job on behalf of some arthropod client. Players
can choose from six classes (Ants (plural), Beetle, Ladybug, Scorpion, Spider,
and Wasp), or create an entirely new class from their imaginations. Nests are the
homes of eusocial insects: the nests of Bees, Ants and Termites. Common Jobs are 
to assasinate the Queen, or the King; steal nectar, honey, honeydew, aphids or
mealybugs (farmed by ants) or fungi (cultivated by termites); steal, or kill, 
larvae; deliver, or pick up a message; or sabotage the Nest.

### The Nest

At the beginning of a new game the players' characters enter a Nest to carry out
their Job armed with their natural weapons and armour: mandibles, pincers,
stingers, carapaces, wings, venom, webs. During a Job characters must survive
combat with the soldier castes guarding the Nests. They must also hunt or forage
for food to avoid weakening and starving to death. While foraging, characters
may find food items, such as nectar and fungi, that can be consumed to provide
not only sustenance but also healing, enhanced physical and mental abilities and
other benefits.

### A tabletop roleplaying game

Nests & Insects is a tabletop roleplaying game: the players say what their
characters want to do and roll the dice to see what happens. Then the Game Queen
describes the results of the characters' actions. Nests & Insects' roleplaying
system is a dice pool system where a pool of d6s are rolled to determine the
outcome of actions and quantify the results of actions. The system is designed to
remove all mental arithmetic from "action resolution" and to encourage the players
to use their imagination to help their characters achieve their goals. Everything 
characters encounter in Nests & Insects is procedurally generated: the Nest, its
guardians, items, all challenges and rewards.

### A roguelike tabletop roleplaying game

Nests & Insects is a "Roguelike" TTRPG: it is inspired by Roguelike Computer
RPGs (CRPGs) such as Nethack, Angband, Moria, ADoM and newer games like Diablo
and Darkest Dungeon. From Roguelike CRPGs it borrows: procedural generation;
hack-and-slash, dungeon-crawling gameplay; lethal combat; hunger mechanics; and
a focus on exploration and experimentation with the game world. From TTRPGs it
borrows: weird dice; tortuous terminology with Pompous Capitalisation;
over-engineered rules; unclear motivation to learn yet another roleplaying
system; and crunch Crunch CRrRUNCH!

Nests & Insects: What's this Metamorphosis?
---------------

Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis is built upon and inspired by the original system
for Nests & Insects. The aim of Metamorphosis was to take the game as it existed
re-shape it into a different vision, and polish it into something to share with
the world. Credit for the original Nests & Insects goes to YeGoblynQueenne;
Playtesters A.D.A., Lost Body, and Jimmy; and Cover Page Artist LDA (Mistigris).

Nests & Insects: Metamorphosis forks from the original repository, and all changes
therein are made by Planetaeus with input from close friends and family. You can

understood sense of "source code writte in a programming language".

In particular, where the word "software" appears in the GNU GPL v.3 ", and for
the puproses of licensing Nests & Insects, that word should be interpreted as
saying _software and other kinds of works, including game rules text_, instead.

Should there be any doubts about the licensing of parts of the text in this

except that some text may not have a compiler, or may not be designed to be
executed by a computer, but a human brain.
